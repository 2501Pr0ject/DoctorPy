  "content": "DirEntry instances are not intended to be stored in long-lived data structures; if you know the file metadata has changed or if a long time has elapsed since calling scandir(), call os. stat(entry. path) to fetch up-to-date information. os. DirEntry scandir() os. stat(entry. path) Because the os. DirEntry methods can make operating system calls, they may also raise OSError. If you need very fine-grained control over errors, you can catch OSError when calling one of the os. DirEntry methods and handle as appropriate. os. DirEntry OSError OSError os. DirEntry To be directly usable as a path-like object, os. DirEntry implements the PathLike interface. os. DirEntry PathLike Attributes and methods on a os. DirEntry instance are as follows: os. DirEntry The entry’s base filename, relative to the scandir() path argument. scandir() The name attribute will be bytes if the scandir() path argument is of type bytes and str otherwise. Use fsdecode() to decode byte filenames. name bytes scandir() bytes str fsdecode() The entry’s full path name: equivalent to os. path. join(scandir_path, entry. name) where scandir_path is the scandir() path argument. The path is only absolute if the scandir() path argument was absolute. If the scandir() path argument was a file descriptor, the path attribute is the same as the name attribute. os. path. join(scandir_path, entry. name) scandir() scandir() scandir() path name The path attribute will be bytes if the scandir() path argument is of type bytes and str otherwise. Use fsdecode() to decode byte filenames. path bytes scandir() bytes str fsdecode() Return the inode number of the entry. The result is cached on the os. DirEntry object. Use os. stat(entry. path, follow_symlinks=False). st_ino to fetch up-to-date information. os. DirEntry os. stat(entry. path, follow_symlinks=False). st_ino On the first, uncached call, a system call is required on Windows but not on Unix. Return True if this entry is a directory or a symbolic link pointing to a directory; return False if the entry is or points to any other kind of file, or if it doesn’t exist anymore.",
