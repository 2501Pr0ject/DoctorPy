What Now. ¶ Reading this tutorial has probably reinforced your interest in using Python — you should be eager to apply Python to solving your real-world problems. Where should you go to learn more. This tutorial is part of Python’s documentation set. Some other documents in the set are: The Python Standard Library: You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard library. The standard Python distribution includes a lot of additional code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate random numbers, parse command-line options, compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of what’s available.
