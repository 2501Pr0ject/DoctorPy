This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list: >>> correct_rgba = rgba[:] >>> correct_rgba[-1] = "Alpha" >>> correct_rgba ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Alpha"] >>> rgba ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Alph"] Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the list or clear it entirely: >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'] >>> letters ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'] >>> # replace some values >>> letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E'] >>> letters ['a', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'f', 'g'] >>> # now remove them >>> letters[2:5] = [] >>> letters ['a', 'b', 'f', 'g'] >>> # clear the list by replacing all the elements with an empty list >>> letters[:] = [] >>> letters [] The built-in function len() also applies to lists: len() >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] >>> len(letters) 4 It is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists), for example: >>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c'] >>> n = [1, 2, 3] >>> x = [a, n] >>> x [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]] >>> x[0] ['a', 'b', 'c'] >>> x[0][1] 'b' ## 3. 2. First Steps Towards ProgrammingÂ¶ Of course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows: >>> # Fibonacci series: >>> # the sum of two elements defines the next >>> a, b = 0, 1 >>> while a < 10:. print(a). a, b = b, a+b. 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 This example introduces several new features. The first line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1.
