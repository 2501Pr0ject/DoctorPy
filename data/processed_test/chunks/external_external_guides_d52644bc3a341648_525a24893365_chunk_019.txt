While both expressions are functionally identical, the former is more readable and preferred:# Correct: if foo is not None: # Wrong: if not foo is None: is not not. is # Correct: if foo is not None: # Wrong: if not foo is None: When implementing ordering operations with rich comparisons, it is best to implement all six operations (eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge) rather than relying on other code to only exercise a particular comparison. To minimize the effort involved, the functools. total_ordering() decorator provides a tool to generate missing comparison methods. PEP 207 indicates that reflexivity rules are assumed by Python. Thus, the interpreter may swap y > x with x < y, y >= x with x <= y, and may swap the arguments of x == y and x. = y. The sort() and min() operations are guaranteed to use the < operator and the max() function uses the > operator. However, it is best to implement all six operations so that confusion doesn’t arise in other contexts. __eq__ __ne__ __lt__ __le__ __gt__ __ge__ To minimize the effort involved, the functools. total_ordering() decorator provides a tool to generate missing comparison methods. functools. total_ordering() PEP 207 indicates that reflexivity rules are assumed by Python.

This is more useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i. e.
