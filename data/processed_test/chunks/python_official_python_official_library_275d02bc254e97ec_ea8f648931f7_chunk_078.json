This options flag causes waitpid(), wait3(), wait4(), and waitid() to return right away if no child process status is available immediately. waitpid() wait3() wait4() waitid() Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. This options flag causes waitid() to leave the child in a waitable state, so that a later wait() call can be used to retrieve the child status information again. waitid() wait*() This option is not available for the other wait functions. wait* Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. These are the possible values for si_code in the result returned by waitid(). si_code waitid() Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Added in version 3. 3. Changed in version 3. 9: Added CLD_KILLED and CLD_STOPPED values. CLD_KILLED CLD_STOPPED Convert a wait status to an exit code. On Unix: If the process exited normally (if WIFEXITED(status) is true), return the process exit status (return WEXITSTATUS(status)): result greater than or equal to 0. If the process exited normally (if WIFEXITED(status) is true), return the process exit status (return WEXITSTATUS(status)): result greater than or equal to 0. WIFEXITED(status) WEXITSTATUS(status) If the process was terminated by a signal (if WIFSIGNALED(status) is true), return -signum where signum is the number of the signal that caused the process to terminate (return -WTERMSIG(status)): result less than 0. If the process was terminated by a signal (if WIFSIGNALED(status) is true), return -signum where signum is the number of the signal that caused the process to terminate (return -WTERMSIG(status)): result less than 0. WIFSIGNALED(status) -signum -WTERMSIG(status) Otherwise, raise a ValueError. Otherwise, raise a ValueError. ValueError On Windows, return status shifted right by 8 bits. On Unix, if the process is being traced or if waitpid() was called with WUNTRACED option, the caller must first check if WIFSTOPPED(status) is true.",
