  "content": "The local wall clock leaps from 1:59 (daylight time) back to 1:00 (standard time) again. Local times of the form 1:MM are ambiguous. astimezone() mimics the local clock’s behavior by mapping two adjacent UTC hours into the same local hour then. In the Eastern example, UTC times of the form 5:MM and 6:MM both map to 1:MM when converted to Eastern, but earlier times have the fold attribute set to 0 and the later times have it set to 1. For example, at the Fall back transition of 2016, we get: astimezone() fold >>> u0 = datetime(2016, 11, 6, 4, tzinfo=timezone. utc) >>> for i in range(4):. u = u0 + i*HOUR. t = u. astimezone(Eastern). print(u. time(), 'UTC =', t. time(), t. tzname(), t. fold). 04:00:00 UTC = 00:00:00 EDT 0 05:00:00 UTC = 01:00:00 EDT 0 06:00:00 UTC = 01:00:00 EST 1 07:00:00 UTC = 02:00:00 EST 0 Note that the datetime instances that differ only by the value of the fold attribute are considered equal in comparisons. datetime fold Applications that can’t bear wall-time ambiguities should explicitly check the value of the fold attribute or avoid using hybrid tzinfo subclasses; there are no ambiguities when using timezone, or any other fixed-offset tzinfo subclass (such as a class representing only EST (fixed offset -5 hours), or only EDT (fixed offset -4 hours)). fold tzinfo timezone tzinfo See also zoneinfo The datetime module has a basic timezone class (for handling arbitrary fixed offsets from UTC) and its timezone. utc attribute (a UTC timezone instance). datetime timezone timezone. utc timezone zoneinfo brings the IANA time zone database (also known as the Olson database) to Python, and its usage is recommended. zoneinfo The Time Zone Database (often called tz, tzdata or zoneinfo) contains code and data that represent the history of local time for many representative locations around the globe.",
