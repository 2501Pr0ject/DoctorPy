  "content": "For a (slightly) more portable approach, use the pty module. (master, slave) pty Availability: Unix, not WASI. Changed in version 3. 4: The new file descriptors are now non-inheritable. Create a pipe. Return a pair of file descriptors (r, w) usable for reading and writing, respectively. The new file descriptor is non-inheritable. (r, w) Availability: Unix, Windows. Changed in version 3. 4: The new file descriptors are now non-inheritable. Create a pipe with flags set atomically. flags can be constructed by ORing together one or more of these values: O_NONBLOCK, O_CLOEXEC. Return a pair of file descriptors (r, w) usable for reading and writing, respectively. O_NONBLOCK O_CLOEXEC (r, w) Availability: Unix, not WASI. Added in version 3. 3. Ensures that enough disk space is allocated for the file specified by fd starting from offset and continuing for len bytes. Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. Announces an intention to access data in a specific pattern thus allowing the kernel to make optimizations. The advice applies to the region of the file specified by fd starting at offset and continuing for len bytes. advice is one of POSIX_FADV_NORMAL, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL, POSIX_FADV_RANDOM, POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE, POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED or POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED. POSIX_FADV_NORMAL POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL POSIX_FADV_RANDOM POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. Flags that can be used in advice in posix_fadvise() that specify the access pattern that is likely to be used. posix_fadvise() Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. Read at most n bytes from file descriptor fd at a position of offset, leaving the file offset unchanged. Return a bytestring containing the bytes read. If the end of the file referred to by fd has been reached, an empty bytes object is returned. Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. Open and return a file descriptor for a master pseudo-terminal device. Calls the C standard library function posix_openpt().",
