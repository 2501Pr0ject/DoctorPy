  "content": "Here, the eye has to do extra work to tell which items are added and which are subtracted: # Wrong: # operators sit far away from their operands income = (gross_wages + taxable_interest + (dividends - qualified_dividends) - ira_deduction - student_loan_interest) To solve this readability problem, mathematicians and their publishers follow the opposite convention. Donald Knuth explains the traditional rule in his Computers and Typesetting series: “Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations” [3]. Following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more readable code: # Correct: # easy to match operators with operands income = (gross_wages + taxable_interest + (dividends - qualified_dividends) - ira_deduction - student_loan_interest) In Python code, it is permissible to break before or after a binary operator, as long as the convention is consistent locally. For new code Knuth’s style is suggested. ### Blank Lines Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines. Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line. Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (e. g. a set of dummy implementations). Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections. Python accepts the control-L (i. e. ^L) form feed character as whitespace; many tools treat these characters as page separators, so you may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file. Note, some editors and web-based code viewers may not recognize control-L as a form feed and will show another glyph in its place. ### Source File Encoding Code in the core Python distribution should always use UTF-8, and should not have an encoding declaration. In the standard library, non-UTF-8 encodings should be used only for test purposes. Use non-ASCII characters sparingly, preferably only to denote places and human names. If using non-ASCII characters as data, avoid noisy Unicode characters like z̯̯͡a̧͎̺l̡͓̫g̹̲o̡̼̘ and byte order marks.",
