BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns an io. BufferedRandom. When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of io. RawIOBase, io. FileIO, is returned. open() open() 'w' 'r' 'wt' 'rt' io. TextIOBase io. TextIOWrapper io. BufferedIOBase io. BufferedReader io. BufferedWriter io. BufferedRandom io. RawIOBase io.
