## Whitespace in Expressions and Statements ### Pet Peeves Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations: Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces:# Correct: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2}) # Wrong: spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } ) # Correct: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2}) # Wrong: spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } ) Between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis:# Correct: foo = (0,) # Wrong: bar = (0, ) # Correct: foo = (0,) # Wrong: bar = (0, ) Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon:# Correct: if x == 4: print(x, y); x, y = y, x # Wrong: if x == 4 : print(x , y) ; x , y = y , x # Correct: if x == 4: print(x, y); x, y = y, x # Wrong: if x == 4 : print(x , y) ; x , y = y , x However, in a slice the colon acts like a binary operator, and should have equal amounts on either side (treating it as the operator with the lowest priority). In an extended slice, both colons must have the same amount of spacing applied.
