  "content": "zip() Tips and tricks: The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables is guaranteed. This makes possible an idiom for clustering a data series into n-length groups using zip([iter(s)]n, strict=True). This repeats the same iterator n times so that each output tuple has the result of n calls to the iterator. This has the effect of dividing the input into n-length chunks. The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables is guaranteed. This makes possible an idiom for clustering a data series into n-length groups using zip([iter(s)]n, strict=True). This repeats the same iterator n times so that each output tuple has the result of n calls to the iterator. This has the effect of dividing the input into n-length chunks. zip(*[iter(s)]*n, strict=True) n n zip() in conjunction with the * operator can be used to unzip a list: >>> x = [1, 2, 3] >>> y = [4, 5, 6] >>> list(zip(x, y)) [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)] >>> x2, y2 = zip(*zip(x, y)) >>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2) True zip() in conjunction with the * operator can be used to unzip a list: zip() * >>> x = [1, 2, 3] >>> y = [4, 5, 6] >>> list(zip(x, y)) [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)] >>> x2, y2 = zip(*zip(x, y)) >>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2) True Changed in version 3. 10: Added the strict argument. strict Note This is an advanced function that is not needed in everyday Python programming, unlike importlib. import_module(). importlib. import_module() This function is invoked by the import statement. It can be replaced (by importing the builtins module and assigning to builtins. import) in order to change semantics of the import statement, but doing so is strongly discouraged as it is usually simpler to use import hooks (see PEP 302) to attain the same goals and does not cause issues with code which assumes the default import implementation is in use. Direct use of import() is also discouraged in favor of importlib. import_module().",
