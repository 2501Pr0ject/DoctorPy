  "content": "The mode argument defaults to the midpoint between the bounds, giving a symmetric distribution. low <= N <= high Beta distribution. Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0. Returned values range between 0 and 1. alpha > 0 beta > 0 Exponential distribution. lambd is 1. 0 divided by the desired mean. It should be nonzero. (The parameter would be called “lambda”, but that is a reserved word in Python. ) Returned values range from 0 to positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative infinity to 0 if lambd is negative. Changed in version 3. 12: Added the default value for lambd. lambd Gamma distribution. (Not the gamma function. ) The shape and scale parameters, alpha and beta, must have positive values. (Calling conventions vary and some sources define ‘beta’ as the inverse of the scale). The probability distribution function is: x ** (alpha - 1) * math. exp(-x / beta) pdf(x) = -------------------------------------- math. gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha Normal distribution, also called the Gaussian distribution. mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation. This is slightly faster than the normalvariate() function defined below. normalvariate() Multithreading note: When two threads call this function simultaneously, it is possible that they will receive the same return value. This can be avoided in three ways. 1) Have each thread use a different instance of the random number generator. 2) Put locks around all calls. 3) Use the slower, but thread-safe normalvariate() function instead. normalvariate() Changed in version 3. 11: mu and sigma now have default arguments. Log normal distribution. If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you’ll get a normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma. mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero. Normal distribution. mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation. Changed in version 3. 11: mu and sigma now have default arguments. mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2pi, and kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or equal to zero. If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi. Pareto distribution.",
