Note When formatting a number (int, float, complex, decimal. Decimal and subclasses) with the n type (ex: '{:n}'. format(1234)), the function temporarily sets the LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC locale to decode decimal_point and thousands_sep fields of localeconv() if they are non-ASCII or longer than 1 byte, and the LC_NUMERIC locale is different than the LC_CTYPE locale. This temporary change affects other threads. int float complex decimal. Decimal n '{:n}'. format(1234) LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC decimal_point thousands_sep localeconv() LC_NUMERIC LC_CTYPE Changed in version 3. 7: When formatting a number with the n type, the function sets temporarily the LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC locale in some cases. n LC_CTYPE LC_NUMERIC Similar to str. format(mapping), except that mapping is used directly and not copied to a dict. This is useful if for example mapping is a dict subclass: str. format(**mapping) mapping dict mapping >>> class Default(dict):. def __missing__(self, key):. return key. >>> '{name} was born in {country}'. format_map(Default(name='Guido')) 'Guido was born in country' Added in version 3. 2. Like find(), but raise ValueError when the substring is not found. find() ValueError Return True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and there is at least one character, False otherwise. A character c is alphanumeric if one of the following returns True: c. isalpha(), c. isdecimal(), c. isdigit(), or c. isnumeric(). True False c True c. isalpha() c. isdecimal() c. isdigit() c. isnumeric() Return True if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, False otherwise. Alphabetic characters are those characters defined in the Unicode character database as “Letter”, i. e. , those with general category property being one of “Lm”, “Lt”, “Lu”, “Ll”, or “Lo”. Note that this is different from the Alphabetic property defined in the section 4. 10 ‘Letters, Alphabetic, and Ideographic’ of the Unicode Standard. True False Return True if the string is empty or all characters in the string are ASCII, False otherwise.
