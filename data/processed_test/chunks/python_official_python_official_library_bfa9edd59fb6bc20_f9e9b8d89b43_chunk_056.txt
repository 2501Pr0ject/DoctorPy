splitlines() ([], [b'One line']) Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart and vice-versa. For example: >>> b'Hello World'. swapcase() b'hELLO wORLD' Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' Unlike str. swapcase(), it is always the case that bin. swapcase(). swapcase() == bin for the binary versions. Case conversions are symmetrical in ASCII, even though that is not generally true for arbitrary Unicode code points. str. swapcase() bin. swapcase(). swapcase() == bin Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. Return a titlecased version of the binary sequence where words start with an uppercase ASCII character and the remaining characters are lowercase. Uncased byte values are left unmodified. For example: >>> b'Hello world'. title() b'Hello World' Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. All other byte values are uncased. b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters. The definition works in many contexts but it means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries, which may not be the desired result: >>> b"they're bill's friends from the UK". title() b"They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk" A workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular expressions: >>> import re >>> def titlecase(s):. return re. sub(rb"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+). ",. lambda mo: mo. group(0)[0:1]. upper() +. mo. group(0)[1:]. lower(),. s). >>> titlecase(b"they're bill's friends. ") b"They're Bill's Friends. " Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart. For example: >>> b'Hello World'.
