  "content": "system(), popen() or fork() and execv(). os. system() popen() fork() execv() Assignments to items in os. environ are automatically translated into corresponding calls to putenv(); however, calls to putenv() don’t update os. environ, so it is actually preferable to assign to items of os. environ. This also applies to getenv() and getenvb(), which respectively use os. environ and os. environb in their implementations. os. environ putenv() putenv() os. environ os. environ getenv() getenvb() os. environ os. environb Note On some platforms, including FreeBSD and macOS, setting environ may cause memory leaks.

Set the current process’s effective group id. Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android. Set the current process’s effective user id. Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android. Set the current process’ group id. Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android. Set the list of supplemental group ids associated with the current process to groups. groups must be a sequence, and each element must be an integer identifying a group. This operation is typically available only to the superuser. Availability: Unix, not WASI. Note On macOS, the length of groups may not exceed the system-defined maximum number of effective group ids, typically 16. See the documentation for getgroups() for cases where it may not return the same group list set by calling setgroups(). getgroups() Reassociate the current thread with a Linux namespace. See the setns(2) and namespaces(7) man pages for more details. If fd refers to a /proc/pid/ns/ link, setns() reassociates the calling thread with the namespace associated with that link, and nstype may be set to one of the CLONE_NEW constants to impose constraints on the operation (0 means no constraints). /proc/pid/ns/ setns() 0 Since Linux 5. 8, fd may refer to a PID file descriptor obtained from pidfd_open(). In this case, setns() reassociates the calling thread into one or more of the same namespaces as the thread referred to by fd.",
