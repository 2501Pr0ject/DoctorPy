Customizing class creation¶ Whenever a class inherits from another class, init_subclass() is called on the parent class. This way, it is possible to write classes which change the behavior of subclasses. This is closely related to class decorators, but where class decorators only affect the specific class they’re applied to, init_subclass solely applies to future subclasses of the class defining the method. __init_subclass__() __init_subclass__ This method is called whenever the containing class is subclassed. cls is then the new subclass. If defined as a normal instance method, this method is implicitly converted to a class method. Keyword arguments which are given to a new class are passed to the parent class’s init_subclass. For compatibility with other classes using init_subclass, one should take out the needed keyword arguments and pass the others over to the base class, as in: __init_subclass__ __init_subclass__ class Philosopher: def __init_subclass__(cls, /, default_name, **kwargs): super(). __init_subclass__(**kwargs) cls.",
