A non-normative HTML file listing all valid identifier characters for Unicode 15. 1. 0 can be found at  ### 2. 3. 1. Keywords¶ The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or keywords of the language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers. They must be spelled exactly as written here: False await else import pass None break except in raise True class finally is return and continue for lambda try as def from nonlocal while assert del global not with async elif if or yield ### 2. 3. 2. Soft Keywords¶ Added in version 3. 10. Some identifiers are only reserved under specific contexts. These are known as soft keywords. The identifiers match, case, type and _ can syntactically act as keywords in certain contexts, but this distinction is done at the parser level, not when tokenizing.",
