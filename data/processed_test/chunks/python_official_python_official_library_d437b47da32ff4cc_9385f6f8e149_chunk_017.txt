If cache_tag is set to None, it indicates that module caching should be disabled. 'cpython-33' cache_tag None sys. implementation may contain additional attributes specific to the Python implementation. These non-standard attributes must start with an underscore, and are not described here. Regardless of its contents, sys. implementation will not change during a run of the interpreter, nor between implementation versions. (It may change between Python language versions, however. ) See PEP 421 for more information. sys. implementation sys. implementation Added in version 3. 3. Note The addition of new required attributes must go through the normal PEP process. See PEP 421 for more information. A named tuple that holds information about Python’s internal representation of integers. The attributes are read only. The number of bits held in each digit. Python integers are stored internally in base 2int_info. bits_per_digit. 2**int_info. bits_per_digit The size in bytes of the C type used to represent a digit. The default value for sys. get_int_max_str_digits() when it is not otherwise explicitly configured. sys. get_int_max_str_digits() The minimum non-zero value for sys. set_int_max_str_digits(), PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS, or -X int_max_str_digits. sys. set_int_max_str_digits() PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS -X int_max_str_digits Added in version 3. 1. Changed in version 3. 11: Added default_max_str_digits and str_digits_check_threshold. default_max_str_digits str_digits_check_threshold When this attribute exists, its value is automatically called (with no arguments) when the interpreter is launched in interactive mode. This is done after the PYTHONSTARTUP file is read, so that you can set this hook there. The site module sets this. PYTHONSTARTUP site Raises an auditing event cpython. run_interactivehook with the hook object as the argument when the hook is called on startup. Raises an auditing event cpython. run_interactivehook with the hook object as the argument when the hook is called on startup. cpython. run_interactivehook Added in version 3. 4. Enter string in the table of “interned” strings and return the interned string – which is string itself or a copy.
