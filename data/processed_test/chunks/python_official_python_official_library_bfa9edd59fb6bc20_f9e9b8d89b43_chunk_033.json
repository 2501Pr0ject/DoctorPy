  "content": "removeprefix() for a method that will remove a single prefix string rather than all of a set of characters. For example: str. removeprefix() >>> 'Arthur: three. '. lstrip('Arthur: ') 'ee. ' >>> 'Arthur: three. '. removeprefix('Arthur: ') 'three. ' This static method returns a translation table usable for str. translate(). str. translate() If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode ordinals (integers) or characters (strings of length 1) to Unicode ordinals, strings (of arbitrary lengths) or None. Character keys will then be converted to ordinals. None If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result. None Split the string at the first occurrence of sep, and return a 3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing the string itself, followed by two empty strings. If the string starts with the prefix string, return string[len(prefix):]. Otherwise, return a copy of the original string: string[len(prefix):] >>> 'TestHook'. removeprefix('Test') 'Hook' >>> 'BaseTestCase'. removeprefix('Test') 'BaseTestCase' Added in version 3. 9. If the string ends with the suffix string and that suffix is not empty, return string[:-len(suffix)]. Otherwise, return a copy of the original string: string[:-len(suffix)] >>> 'MiscTests'. removesuffix('Tests') 'Misc' >>> 'TmpDirMixin'. removesuffix('Tests') 'TmpDirMixin' Added in version 3. 9. Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new. If count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. If count is not specified or -1, then all occurrences are replaced. -1 Changed in version 3. 13: count is now supported as a keyword argument. Return the highest index in the string where substring sub is found, such that sub is contained within s[start:end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 on failure.",
