Valid values for whence are: SEEK_SET or 0 – set pos relative to the beginning of the file SEEK_SET or 0 – set pos relative to the beginning of the file SEEK_SET 0 SEEK_CUR or 1 – set pos relative to the current file position SEEK_CUR or 1 – set pos relative to the current file position SEEK_CUR 1 SEEK_END or 2 – set pos relative to the end of the file SEEK_END or 2 – set pos relative to the end of the file SEEK_END 2 SEEK_HOLE – set pos to the next data location, relative to pos SEEK_HOLE – set pos to the next data location, relative to pos SEEK_HOLE SEEK_DATA – set pos to the next data hole, relative to pos SEEK_DATA – set pos to the next data hole, relative to pos SEEK_DATA Changed in version 3. 3: Add support for SEEK_HOLE and SEEK_DATA. SEEK_HOLE SEEK_DATA Parameters to the lseek() function and the seek() method on file-like objects, for whence to adjust the file position indicator. lseek() seek() SEEK_SET Adjust the file position relative to the beginning of the file. SEEK_CUR Adjust the file position relative to the current file position. SEEK_END Adjust the file position relative to the end of the file. Their values are 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Parameters to the lseek() function and the seek() method on file-like objects, for seeking file data and holes on sparsely allocated files. lseek() seek() SEEK_DATA Adjust the file offset to the next location containing data, relative to the seek position. SEEK_HOLE Adjust the file offset to the next location containing a hole, relative to the seek position. A hole is defined as a sequence of zeros. Note These operations only make sense for filesystems that support them. Availability: Linux >= 3. 1, macOS, Unix Added in version 3. 3. Open the file path and set various flags according to flags and possibly its mode according to mode. When computing mode, the current umask value is first masked out. Return the file descriptor for the newly opened file. The new file descriptor is non-inheritable. For a description of the flag and mode values, see the C run-time documentation; flag constants (like O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY) are defined in the os module.
