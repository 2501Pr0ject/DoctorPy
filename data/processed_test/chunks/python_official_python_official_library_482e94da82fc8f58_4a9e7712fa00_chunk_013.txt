__cause__, rest. __notes__ (MyGroup('eg', [TypeError(2)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note']) >>> exc. __traceback__ is match. __traceback__ is rest. __traceback__ True Note that BaseExceptionGroup defines new(), so subclasses that need a different constructor signature need to override that rather than init(). For example, the following defines an exception group subclass which accepts an exit_code and and constructs the groupâ€™s message from it. BaseExceptionGroup __new__() __init__() class Errors(ExceptionGroup): def __new__(cls, errors, exit_code): self = super(). __new__(Errors, f"exit code: {exit_code}", errors) self. exit_code = exit_code return self def derive(self, excs): return Errors(excs, self. exit_code) Like ExceptionGroup, any subclass of BaseExceptionGroup which is also a subclass of Exception can only wrap instances of Exception.
