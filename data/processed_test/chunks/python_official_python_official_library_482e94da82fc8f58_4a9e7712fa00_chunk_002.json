  "content": "SomeException OtherException OtherException SomeException try:. except SomeException: tb = sys. exception(). __traceback__ raise OtherException(. ). with_traceback(tb) A writable field that holds the traceback object associated with this exception. See also: The raise statement. Add the string note to the exception’s notes which appear in the standard traceback after the exception string. A TypeError is raised if note is not a string. note TypeError note Added in version 3. 11. A list of the notes of this exception, which were added with add_note(). This attribute is created when add_note() is called. add_note() add_note() Added in version 3. 11. All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class. All user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class. The base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various arithmetic errors: OverflowError, ZeroDivisionError, FloatingPointError. OverflowError ZeroDivisionError FloatingPointError Raised when a buffer related operation cannot be performed. The base class for the exceptions that are raised when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid: IndexError, KeyError. This can be raised directly by codecs. lookup(). IndexError KeyError codecs. lookup() ## Concrete exceptions¶ The following exceptions are the exceptions that are usually raised. Raised when an assert statement fails. assert Raised when an attribute reference (see Attribute references) or assignment fails. (When an object does not support attribute references or attribute assignments at all, TypeError is raised. ) TypeError The name and obj attributes can be set using keyword-only arguments to the constructor. When set they represent the name of the attribute that was attempted to be accessed and the object that was accessed for said attribute, respectively. name obj Changed in version 3. 10: Added the name and obj attributes. name obj Raised when the input() function hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data. (N. B. : the io. IOBase. read() and io. IOBase. readline() methods return an empty string when they hit EOF. ) input() io. IOBase. read() io. IOBase. readline() Not currently used. Raised when a generator or coroutine is closed; see generator. close() and coroutine. close(). It directly inherits from BaseException instead of Exception since it is technically not an error. generator. close() coroutine.",
