The remaining arguments must be integers in the following ranges: None tzinfo MINYEAR <= year <= MAXYEAR, MINYEAR <= year <= MAXYEAR, MINYEAR <= year <= MAXYEAR 1 <= month <= 12, 1 <= month <= 12, 1 <= month <= 12 1 <= day <= number of days in the given month and year, 1 <= day <= number of days in the given month and year, 1 <= day <= number of days in the given month and year 0 <= hour < 24, 0 <= hour < 24, 0 <= hour < 24 0 <= minute < 60, 0 <= minute < 60, 0 <= minute < 60 0 <= second < 60, 0 <= second < 60, 0 <= second < 60 0 <= microsecond < 1000000, 0 <= microsecond < 1000000, 0 <= microsecond < 1000000 fold in [0, 1]. fold in [0, 1]. fold in [0, 1] If an argument outside those ranges is given, ValueError is raised. ValueError Changed in version 3. 6: Added the fold parameter. Other constructors, all class methods: Return the current local date and time, with tzinfo None.",
