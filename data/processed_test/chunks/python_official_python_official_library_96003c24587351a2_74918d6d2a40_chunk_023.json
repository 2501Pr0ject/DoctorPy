  "content": "On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long. Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device’s “block size” and falling back on io. DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE. On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long. io. DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE “Interactive” text files (files for which isatty() returns True) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. “Interactive” text files (files for which isatty() returns True) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. isatty() True encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale. getencoding() returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings. locale. getencoding() codecs errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled—this cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard error handlers are available (listed under Error Handlers), though any error handling name that has been registered with codecs. register_error() is also valid. The standard names include: codecs. register_error() 'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of None has the same effect. 'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of None has the same effect. 'strict' ValueError None 'ignore' ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss. 'ignore' ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss. 'ignore' 'replace' causes a replacement marker (such as '. ') to be inserted where there is malformed data. 'replace' causes a replacement marker (such as '. ') to be inserted where there is malformed data. 'replace' '. ' 'surrogateescape' will represent any incorrect bytes as low surrogate code units ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These surrogate code units will then be turned back into the same bytes when the surrogateescape error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding.",
