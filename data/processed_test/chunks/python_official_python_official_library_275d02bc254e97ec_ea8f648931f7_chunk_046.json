  "content": "dwFileAttributes BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION GetFileInformationByHandle() FILE_ATTRIBUTE_* <stat. FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE> stat Added in version 3. 5. When st_file_attributes has the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT set, this field contains the tag identifying the type of reparse point. See the IO_REPARSE_TAG_ constants in the stat module. st_file_attributes FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT IO_REPARSE_TAG_* stat The standard module stat defines functions and constants that are useful for extracting information from a stat structure. (On Windows, some items are filled with dummy values. ) stat stat For backward compatibility, a stat_result instance is also accessible as a tuple of at least 10 integers giving the most important (and portable) members of the stat structure, in the order st_mode, st_ino, st_dev, st_nlink, st_uid, st_gid, st_size, st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime. More items may be added at the end by some implementations. For compatibility with older Python versions, accessing stat_result as a tuple always returns integers. stat_result stat st_mode st_ino st_dev st_nlink st_uid st_gid st_size st_atime st_mtime st_ctime stat_result Changed in version 3. 5: Windows now returns the file index as st_ino when available. st_ino Changed in version 3. 7: Added the st_fstype member to Solaris/derivatives. st_fstype Changed in version 3. 8: Added the st_reparse_tag member on Windows. st_reparse_tag Changed in version 3. 8: On Windows, the st_mode member now identifies special files as S_IFCHR, S_IFIFO or S_IFBLK as appropriate. st_mode S_IFCHR S_IFIFO S_IFBLK Changed in version 3. 12: On Windows, st_ctime is deprecated. Eventually, it will contain the last metadata change time, for consistency with other platforms, but for now still contains creation time. Use st_birthtime for the creation time. st_ctime st_birthtime On Windows, st_ino may now be up to 128 bits, depending on the file system. Previously it would not be above 64 bits, and larger file identifiers would be arbitrarily packed. st_ino On Windows, st_rdev no longer returns a value. Previously it would contain the same as st_dev, which was incorrect.",
