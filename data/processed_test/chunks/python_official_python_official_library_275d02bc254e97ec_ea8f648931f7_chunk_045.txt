st_birthtime Time of file creation expressed in nanoseconds as an integer. This attribute is not always available, and may raise AttributeError. AttributeError Added in version 3. 12. Note The exact meaning and resolution of the st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime and st_birthtime attributes depend on the operating system and the file system. For example, on Windows systems using the FAT32 file systems, st_mtime has 2-second resolution, and st_atime has only 1-day resolution. See your operating system documentation for details. st_atime st_mtime st_ctime st_birthtime st_mtime st_atime Similarly, although st_atime_ns, st_mtime_ns, st_ctime_ns and st_birthtime_ns are always expressed in nanoseconds, many systems do not provide nanosecond precision. On systems that do provide nanosecond precision, the floating-point object used to store st_atime, st_mtime, st_ctime and st_birthtime cannot preserve all of it, and as such will be slightly inexact. If you need the exact timestamps you should always use st_atime_ns, st_mtime_ns, st_ctime_ns and st_birthtime_ns. st_atime_ns st_mtime_ns st_ctime_ns st_birthtime_ns st_atime st_mtime st_ctime st_birthtime st_atime_ns st_mtime_ns st_ctime_ns st_birthtime_ns On some Unix systems (such as Linux), the following attributes may also be available: Number of 512-byte blocks allocated for file. This may be smaller than st_size/512 when the file has holes. st_size “Preferred” blocksize for efficient file system I/O. Writing to a file in smaller chunks may cause an inefficient read-modify-rewrite. Type of device if an inode device. User defined flags for file. On other Unix systems (such as FreeBSD), the following attributes may be available (but may be only filled out if root tries to use them): File generation number. On Solaris and derivatives, the following attributes may also be available: String that uniquely identifies the type of the filesystem that contains the file. On macOS systems, the following attributes may also be available: Real size of the file. Creator of the file. File type. On Windows systems, the following attributes are also available: Windows file attributes: dwFileAttributes member of the BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION structure returned by GetFileInformationByHandle(). See the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ constants in the stat module.
