Please see the companion informational PEP describing style guidelines for the C code in the C implementation of Python. This document and PEP 257 (Docstring Conventions) were adapted from Guido’s original Python Style Guide essay, with some additions from Barry’s style guide [2]. This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in the language itself. Many projects have their own coding style guidelines. In the event of any conflicts, such project-specific guides take precedence for that project. ## A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds One of Guido’s key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written. The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code.",
