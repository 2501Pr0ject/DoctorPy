Evaluates to n. / (k. * (n - k). ) when k <= n and evaluates to zero when k > n. n. / (k. * (n - k). ) k <= n k > n Also called the binomial coefficient because it is equivalent to the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of (1 + x)ⁿ. (1 + x)ⁿ Raises TypeError if either of the arguments are not integers. Raises ValueError if either of the arguments are negative. TypeError ValueError Added in version 3. 8. Return factorial of the nonnegative integer n. Changed in version 3. 10: Floats with integral values (like 5. 0) are no longer accepted. 5. 0 Return the greatest common divisor of the specified integer arguments. If any of the arguments is nonzero, then the returned value is the largest positive integer that is a divisor of all arguments. If all arguments are zero, then the returned value is 0. gcd() without arguments returns 0. 0 gcd() 0 Added in version 3. 5. Changed in version 3. 9: Added support for an arbitrary number of arguments. Formerly, only two arguments were supported. Return the integer square root of the nonnegative integer n. This is the floor of the exact square root of n, or equivalently the greatest integer a such that a² ≤ n. For some applications, it may be more convenient to have the least integer a such that n ≤ a², or in other words the ceiling of the exact square root of n. For positive n, this can be computed using a = 1 + isqrt(n - 1). a = 1 + isqrt(n - 1) Added in version 3. 8. Return the least common multiple of the specified integer arguments. If all arguments are nonzero, then the returned value is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all arguments. If any of the arguments is zero, then the returned value is 0. lcm() without arguments returns 1.",
