This is subject to any constraints imposed by nstype, which is a bit mask combining one or more of the CLONE_NEW constants, e. g. setns(fd, os. CLONE_NEWUTS | os. CLONE_NEWPID). The caller’s memberships in unspecified namespaces are left unchanged. pidfd_open() setns() setns(fd, os. CLONE_NEWUTS | os. CLONE_NEWPID) fd can be any object with a fileno() method, or a raw file descriptor. fileno() This example reassociates the thread with the init process’s network namespace: init fd = os. open("/proc/1/ns/net", os. O_RDONLY) os. setns(fd, os. CLONE_NEWNET) os. close(fd) Availability: Linux >= 3. 0 with glibc >= 2. 14. Added in version 3. 12. See also The unshare() function. unshare() Call the system call setpgrp() or setpgrp(0, 0) depending on which version is implemented (if any). See the Unix manual for the semantics. setpgrp() setpgrp(0, 0) Availability: Unix, not WASI. Call the system call setpgid() to set the process group id of the process with id pid to the process group with id pgrp. See the Unix manual for the semantics. setpgid() Availability: Unix, not WASI. Set program scheduling priority. The value which is one of PRIO_PROCESS, PRIO_PGRP, or PRIO_USER, and who is interpreted relative to which (a process identifier for PRIO_PROCESS, process group identifier for PRIO_PGRP, and a user ID for PRIO_USER). A zero value for who denotes (respectively) the calling process, the process group of the calling process, or the real user ID of the calling process. priority is a value in the range -20 to 19. The default priority is 0; lower priorities cause more favorable scheduling. PRIO_PROCESS PRIO_PGRP PRIO_USER PRIO_PROCESS PRIO_PGRP PRIO_USER Availability: Unix, not WASI. Added in version 3. 3. Set the current process’s real and effective group ids. Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android. Set the current process’s real, effective, and saved group ids.
