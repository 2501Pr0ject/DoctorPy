Arguments may be integers or floats, and may be positive or negative. Only days, seconds and microseconds are stored internally. Arguments are converted to those units: A millisecond is converted to 1000 microseconds. A millisecond is converted to 1000 microseconds. A minute is converted to 60 seconds. A minute is converted to 60 seconds. An hour is converted to 3600 seconds. An hour is converted to 3600 seconds. A week is converted to 7 days. A week is converted to 7 days. and days, seconds and microseconds are then normalized so that the representation is unique, with 0 <= microseconds < 1000000 0 <= microseconds < 1000000 0 <= microseconds < 1000000 0 <= seconds < 360024 (the number of seconds in one day) 0 <= seconds < 360024 (the number of seconds in one day) 0 <= seconds < 3600*24 -999999999 <= days <= 999999999 -999999999 <= days <= 999999999 -999999999 <= days <= 999999999 The following example illustrates how any arguments besides days, seconds and microseconds are “merged” and normalized into those three resulting attributes: >>> from datetime import timedelta >>> delta = timedelta(. days=50,. seconds=27,. microseconds=10,. milliseconds=29000,. minutes=5,. hours=8,. weeks=2. ) >>> # Only days, seconds, and microseconds remain >>> delta datetime.",
