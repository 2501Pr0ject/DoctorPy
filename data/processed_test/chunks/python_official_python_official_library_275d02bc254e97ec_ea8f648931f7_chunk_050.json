  "content": "3: Added the dir_fd parameter, and now allow target_is_directory on non-Windows platforms. Changed in version 3. 6: Accepts a path-like object for src and dst. Changed in version 3. 8: Added support for unelevated symlinks on Windows with Developer Mode. Force write of everything to disk. Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. Truncate the file corresponding to path, so that it is at most length bytes in size. This function can support specifying a file descriptor. Raises an auditing event os. truncate with arguments path, length. os. truncate path length Availability: Unix, Windows. Added in version 3. 3. Changed in version 3. 5: Added support for Windows Changed in version 3. 6: Accepts a path-like object. Remove (delete) the file path. This function is semantically identical to remove(); the unlink name is its traditional Unix name. Please see the documentation for remove() for further information. remove() unlink remove() Raises an auditing event os. remove with arguments path, dir_fd. os. remove path dir_fd Changed in version 3. 3: Added the dir_fd parameter. Changed in version 3. 6: Accepts a path-like object. Set the access and modified times of the file specified by path. utime() takes two optional parameters, times and ns. These specify the times set on path and are used as follows: utime() If ns is specified, it must be a 2-tuple of the form (atime_ns, mtime_ns) where each member is an int expressing nanoseconds. If ns is specified, it must be a 2-tuple of the form (atime_ns, mtime_ns) where each member is an int expressing nanoseconds. (atime_ns, mtime_ns) If times is not None, it must be a 2-tuple of the form (atime, mtime) where each member is an int or float expressing seconds. If times is not None, it must be a 2-tuple of the form (atime, mtime) where each member is an int or float expressing seconds. None (atime, mtime) If times is None and ns is unspecified, this is equivalent to specifying ns=(atime_ns, mtime_ns) where both times are the current time.",
