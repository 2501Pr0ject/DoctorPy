8: Dictionary views are now reversible. Return a types. MappingProxyType that wraps the original dictionary to which the view refers. types. MappingProxyType Added in version 3. 10. Keys views are set-like since their entries are unique and hashable. Items views also have set-like operations since the (key, value) pairs are unique and the keys are hashable. If all values in an items view are hashable as well, then the items view can interoperate with other sets. (Values views are not treated as set-like since the entries are generally not unique. ) For set-like views, all of the operations defined for the abstract base class collections. abc. Set are available (for example, ==, <, or ^). While using set operators, set-like views accept any iterable as the other operand, unlike sets which only accept sets as the input. collections. abc. Set == < ^ An example of dictionary view usage: >>> dishes = {'eggs': 2, 'sausage': 1, 'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500} >>> keys = dishes. keys() >>> values = dishes. values() >>> # iteration >>> n = 0 >>> for val in values:. n += val. >>> print(n) 504 >>> # keys and values are iterated over in the same order (insertion order) >>> list(keys) ['eggs', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam'] >>> list(values) [2, 1, 1, 500] >>> # view objects are dynamic and reflect dict changes >>> del dishes['eggs'] >>> del dishes['sausage'] >>> list(keys) ['bacon', 'spam'] >>> # set operations >>> keys & {'eggs', 'bacon', 'salad'} {'bacon'} >>> keys ^ {'sausage', 'juice'} == {'juice', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam'} True >>> keys | ['juice', 'juice', 'juice'] == {'bacon', 'spam', 'juice'} True >>> # get back a read-only proxy for the original dictionary >>> values. mapping mappingproxy({'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500}) >>> values. mapping['spam'] 500 ## Context Manager Types¶ Python’s with statement supports the concept of a runtime context defined by a context manager.
