8. Errors and Exceptions. 13. 5 Source:  8. Errors and Exceptions¶ Until now error messages haven’t been more than mentioned, but if you have tried out the examples you have probably seen some. There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions. ## 8. 1. Syntax Errors¶ Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python: >>> while True print('Hello world') File "<stdin>", line 1 while True print('Hello world') ^^^^^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax The parser repeats the offending line and displays little arrows pointing at the place where the error was detected. Note that this is not always the place that needs to be fixed. In the example, the error is detected at the function print(), since a colon (':') is missing just before it. print() ':' The file name ( in our example) and line number are printed so you know where to look in case the input came from a file. <stdin> ## 8. 2. Exceptions¶ Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: you will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown here: >>> 10 * (1/0) Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> 10 * (1/0) ~^~ ZeroDivisionError: division by zero >>> 4 + spam*3 Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> 4 + spam*3 ^^^^ NameError: name 'spam' is not defined >>> '2' + 2 Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> '2' + 2 ~~~~^~~ TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str The last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message: the types in the example are ZeroDivisionError, NameError and TypeError.
