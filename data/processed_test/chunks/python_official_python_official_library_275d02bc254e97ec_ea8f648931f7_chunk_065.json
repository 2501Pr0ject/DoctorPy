Even in code that appears to work, it has never been safe to mix threading with os. fork() on POSIX platforms. The CPython runtime itself has always made API calls that are not safe for use in the child process when threads existed in the parent (such as malloc and free). os. fork() malloc free Users of macOS or users of libc or malloc implementations other than those typically found in glibc to date are among those already more likely to experience deadlocks running such code. See this discussion on fork being incompatible with threads for technical details of why we’re surfacing this longstanding platform compatibility problem to developers. Availability: POSIX, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Fork a child process, using a new pseudo-terminal as the child’s controlling terminal. Return a pair of (pid, fd), where pid is 0 in the child, the new child’s process id in the parent, and fd is the file descriptor of the master end of the pseudo-terminal. For a more portable approach, use the pty module. If an error occurs OSError is raised.
