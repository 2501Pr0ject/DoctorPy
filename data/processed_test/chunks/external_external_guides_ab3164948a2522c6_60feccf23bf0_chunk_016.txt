Most user-defined subclasses of Handler will need to override this emit(). emit() Handler emit() ### Custom Levels¶ Defining your own levels is possible, but should not be necessary, as the existing levels have been chosen on the basis of practical experience. However, if you are convinced that you need custom levels, great care should be exercised when doing this, and it is possibly a very bad idea to define custom levels if you are developing a library. That’s because if multiple library authors all define their own custom levels, there is a chance that the logging output from such multiple libraries used together will be difficult for the using developer to control and/or interpret, because a given numeric value might mean different things for different libraries. ## Useful Handlers¶ In addition to the base Handler class, many useful subclasses are provided: Handler StreamHandler instances send messages to streams (file-like objects). StreamHandler instances send messages to streams (file-like objects). StreamHandler FileHandler instances send messages to disk files. FileHandler instances send messages to disk files. FileHandler BaseRotatingHandler is the base class for handlers that rotate log files at a certain point. It is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, use RotatingFileHandler or TimedRotatingFileHandler. BaseRotatingHandler is the base class for handlers that rotate log files at a certain point. It is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, use RotatingFileHandler or TimedRotatingFileHandler. BaseRotatingHandler RotatingFileHandler TimedRotatingFileHandler RotatingFileHandler instances send messages to disk files, with support for maximum log file sizes and log file rotation. RotatingFileHandler instances send messages to disk files, with support for maximum log file sizes and log file rotation. RotatingFileHandler TimedRotatingFileHandler instances send messages to disk files, rotating the log file at certain timed intervals. TimedRotatingFileHandler instances send messages to disk files, rotating the log file at certain timed intervals. TimedRotatingFileHandler SocketHandler instances send messages to TCP/IP sockets. Since 3. 4, Unix domain sockets are also supported. SocketHandler instances send messages to TCP/IP sockets. Since 3. 4, Unix domain sockets are also supported. SocketHandler DatagramHandler instances send messages to UDP sockets. Since 3. 4, Unix domain sockets are also supported. DatagramHandler instances send messages to UDP sockets. Since 3.
