BufferedIOBase. The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an io. BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an io. BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns an io. BufferedRandom. When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of io. RawIOBase, io. FileIO, is returned. open() open() 'w' 'r' 'wt' 'rt' io. TextIOBase io. TextIOWrapper io. BufferedIOBase io. BufferedReader io. BufferedWriter io. BufferedRandom io. RawIOBase io. FileIO See also the file handling modules, such as fileinput, io (where open() is declared), os, os. path, tempfile, and shutil. fileinput io open() os os. path tempfile shutil Raises an auditing event open with arguments path, mode, flags. open path mode flags The mode and flags arguments may have been modified or inferred from the original call. mode flags Changed in version 3. 3: The opener parameter was added. The opener parameter was added. The 'x' mode was added. The 'x' mode was added. 'x' IOError used to be raised, it is now an alias of OSError. IOError used to be raised, it is now an alias of OSError. IOError OSError FileExistsError is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ('x') already exists. FileExistsError is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ('x') already exists. FileExistsError 'x' Changed in version 3. 4: The file is now non-inheritable. The file is now non-inheritable. Changed in version 3. 5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale). If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale). InterruptedError The 'namereplace' error handler was added. The 'namereplace' error handler was added. 'namereplace' Changed in version 3. 6: Support added to accept objects implementing os. PathLike. Support added to accept objects implementing os. PathLike.
