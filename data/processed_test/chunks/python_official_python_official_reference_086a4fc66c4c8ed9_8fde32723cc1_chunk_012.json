  "content": "The details of the first step, finding and loading modules, are described in greater detail in the section on the import system, which also describes the various types of packages and modules that can be imported, as well as all the hooks that can be used to customize the import system. Note that failures in this step may indicate either that the module could not be located, or that an error occurred while initializing the module, which includes execution of the module’s code. If the requested module is retrieved successfully, it will be made available in the local namespace in one of three ways: If the module name is followed by as, then the name following as is bound directly to the imported module. If the module name is followed by as, then the name following as is bound directly to the imported module. as as If no other name is specified, and the module being imported is a top level module, the module’s name is bound in the local namespace as a reference to the imported module If no other name is specified, and the module being imported is a top level module, the module’s name is bound in the local namespace as a reference to the imported module If the module being imported is not a top level module, then the name of the top level package that contains the module is bound in the local namespace as a reference to the top level package. The imported module must be accessed using its full qualified name rather than directly If the module being imported is not a top level module, then the name of the top level package that contains the module is bound in the local namespace as a reference to the top level package. The imported module must be accessed using its full qualified name rather than directly The from form uses a slightly more complex process: from find the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary; find the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary; from for each of the identifiers specified in the import clauses: check if the imported module has an attribute by that name if not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then check the imported module again for that attribute if the attribute is not found, ImportError is raised.",
