On Windows, run: tutorial-env\\Scripts\\activate On Unix or MacOS, run: source tutorial-env/bin/activate (This script is written for the bash shell. If you use the csh or fish shells, there are alternate activate. csh and activate. fish scripts you should use instead. ) activate. csh activate. fish Activating the virtual environment will change your shell’s prompt to show what virtual environment you’re using, and modify the environment so that running python will get you that particular version and installation of Python. For example: python $ source ~/envs/tutorial-env/bin/activate (tutorial-env) $ python Python 3. 5. 1 (default, May 6 2016, 10:59:36). >>> import sys >>> sys. path ['', '/usr/local/lib/python35. zip',. , '~/envs/tutorial-env/lib/python3. 5/site-packages'] >>> To deactivate a virtual environment, type: deactivate into the terminal. ## 12. 3. Managing Packages with pip¶ You can install, upgrade, and remove packages using a program called pip. By default pip will install packages from the Python Package Index. You can browse the Python Package Index by going to it in your web browser. pip pip has a number of subcommands: “install”, “uninstall”, “freeze”, etc. (Consult the Installing Python Modules guide for complete documentation for pip. ) pip pip You can install the latest version of a package by specifying a package’s name: (tutorial-env) $ python -m pip install novas Collecting novas Downloading novas-3. 1. 1. 3. tar. gz (136kB) Installing collected packages: novas Running setup. py install for novas Successfully installed novas-3. 1. 1. 3 You can also install a specific version of a package by giving the package name followed by == and the version number: == (tutorial-env) $ python -m pip install requests==2. 6. 0 Collecting requests==2. 6. 0 Using cached requests-2. 6. 0-py2. py3-none-any. whl Installing collected packages: requests Successfully installed requests-2. 6.",
