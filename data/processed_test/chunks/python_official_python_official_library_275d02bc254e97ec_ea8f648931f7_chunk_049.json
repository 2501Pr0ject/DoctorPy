  "content": "chdir() accepts open file descriptors for path on your local platform: in supports_fd True os. chdir() os. chdir in os. supports_fd Added in version 3. 3. A set object indicating which functions in the os module accept False for their follow_symlinks parameter on the local platform. Different platforms provide different features, and the underlying functionality Python uses to implement follow_symlinks is not available on all platforms Python supports. For consistency’s sake, functions that may support follow_symlinks always allow specifying the parameter, but will throw an exception if the functionality is used when it’s not locally available. (Specifying True for follow_symlinks is always supported on all platforms. ) set os False True To check whether a particular function accepts False for its follow_symlinks parameter, use the in operator on supports_follow_symlinks. As an example, this expression evaluates to True if you may specify follow_symlinks=False when calling os. stat() on the local platform: False in supports_follow_symlinks True follow_symlinks=False os. stat() os. stat in os. supports_follow_symlinks Added in version 3. 3. Create a symbolic link pointing to src named dst. On Windows, a symlink represents either a file or a directory, and does not morph to the target dynamically. If the target is present, the type of the symlink will be created to match. Otherwise, the symlink will be created as a directory if target_is_directory is True or a file symlink (the default) otherwise. On non-Windows platforms, target_is_directory is ignored. True This function can support paths relative to directory descriptors. Note On newer versions of Windows 10, unprivileged accounts can create symlinks if Developer Mode is enabled. When Developer Mode is not available/enabled, the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege privilege is required, or the process must be run as an administrator. OSError is raised when the function is called by an unprivileged user. OSError Raises an auditing event os. symlink with arguments src, dst, dir_fd. os. symlink src dst dir_fd Availability: Unix, Windows. The function is limited on WASI, see WebAssembly platforms for more information. Changed in version 3. 2: Added support for Windows 6. 0 (Vista) symbolic links. Changed in version 3.",
