X (The flags are described in Module Contents. ) The letters 'a', 'L' and 'u' are mutually exclusive when used as inline flags, so they can’t be combined or follow '-'. Instead, when one of them appears in an inline group, it overrides the matching mode in the enclosing group. In Unicode patterns (. a:. ) switches to ASCII-only matching, and (. u:. ) switches to Unicode matching (default). In bytes patterns (. L:. ) switches to locale dependent matching, and (. a:. ) switches to ASCII-only matching (default). This override is only in effect for the narrow inline group, and the original matching mode is restored outside of the group. 'a' 'L' 'u' '-' (. a:. ) (. u:. ) (. L:. ) (. a:. ) Added in version 3. 6. Changed in version 3. 7: The letters 'a', 'L' and 'u' also can be used in a group. 'a' 'L' 'u' (. >. ) Attempts to match. as if it was a separate regular expression, and if successful, continues to match the rest of the pattern following it. If the subsequent pattern fails to match, the stack can only be unwound to a point before the (. >. ) because once exited, the expression, known as an atomic group, has thrown away all stack points within itself. Thus, (. >. ). would never match anything because first the. would match all characters possible, then, having nothing left to match, the final. would fail to match. Since there are no stack points saved in the Atomic Group, and there is no stack point before it, the entire expression would thus fail to match. (. >. ) (. >. *). *. Added in version 3. 11. (. P<name>. ) Similar to regular parentheses, but the substring matched by the group is accessible via the symbolic group name name. Group names must be valid Python identifiers, and in bytes patterns they can only contain bytes in the ASCII range. Each group name must be defined only once within a regular expression.",
