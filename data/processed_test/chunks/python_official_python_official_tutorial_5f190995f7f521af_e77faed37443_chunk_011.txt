Package authors may also decide not to support it, if they donâ€™t see a use for importing * from their package. For example, the file sound/effects/init. py could contain the following code: import __init__. py __all__ from package import * sound/effects/__init__. py __all__ = ["echo", "surround", "reverse"] This would mean that from sound. effects import * would import the three named submodules of the sound. effects package. from sound. effects import * sound. effects Be aware that submodules might become shadowed by locally defined names. For example, if you added a reverse function to the sound/effects/init. py file, the from sound. effects import * would only import the two submodules echo and surround, but not the reverse submodule, because it is shadowed by the locally defined reverse function: reverse sound/effects/__init__. py from sound. effects import * echo surround reverse reverse __all__ = [ "echo", # refers to the 'echo. py' file "surround", # refers to the 'surround. py' file "reverse", #. refers to the 'reverse' function now. ] def reverse(msg: str): # <-- this name shadows the 'reverse. py' submodule return msg[::-1] # in the case of a 'from sound. effects import *' If all is not defined, the statement from sound. effects import * does not import all submodules from the package sound. effects into the current namespace; it only ensures that the package sound. effects has been imported (possibly running any initialization code in init. py) and then imports whatever names are defined in the package. This includes any names defined (and submodules explicitly loaded) by init. py. It also includes any submodules of the package that were explicitly loaded by previous import statements. Consider this code: __all__ from sound. effects import * sound. effects sound. effects __init__. py __init__. py import import sound. effects. echo import sound. effects. surround from sound. effects import * In this example, the echo and surround modules are imported in the current namespace because they are defined in the sound. effects package when the from. import statement is executed. (This also works when all is defined. ) echo surround sound. effects from.
