The init_subclass() hook is called on the immediate parent of the new class in its method resolution order. __init_subclass__() After the class object is created, it is passed to the class decorators included in the class definition (if any) and the resulting object is bound in the local namespace as the defined class. When a new class is created by type. new, the object provided as the namespace parameter is copied to a new ordered mapping and the original object is discarded. The new copy is wrapped in a read-only proxy, which becomes the dict attribute of the class object. type. __new__ __dict__ See also Describes the implicit class closure reference __class__ #### 3. 3. 3. 7.
