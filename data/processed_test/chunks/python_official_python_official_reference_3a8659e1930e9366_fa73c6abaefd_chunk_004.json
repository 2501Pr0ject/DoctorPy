  "content": "Python does not support single-precision floating-point numbers; the savings in processor and memory usage that are usually the reason for using these are dwarfed by the overhead of using objects in Python, so there is no reason to complicate the language with two kinds of floating-point numbers. #### 3. 2. 4. 3. numbers. Complex (complex)¶ numbers. Complex complex These represent complex numbers as a pair of machine-level double precision floating-point numbers. The same caveats apply as for floating-point numbers. The real and imaginary parts of a complex number z can be retrieved through the read-only attributes z. real and z. imag. z z. real z. imag ### 3. 2. 5. Sequences¶ These represent finite ordered sets indexed by non-negative numbers. The built-in function len() returns the number of items of a sequence. When the length of a sequence is n, the index set contains the numbers 0, 1, …, n-1. Item i of sequence a is selected by a[i]. Some sequences, including built-in sequences, interpret negative subscripts by adding the sequence length. For example, a[-2] equals a[n-2], the second to last item of sequence a with length n. len() a[i] a[-2] a[n-2] n Sequences also support slicing: a[i:j] selects all items with index k such that i <= k < j. When used as an expression, a slice is a sequence of the same type. The comment above about negative indexes also applies to negative slice positions. a[i:j] <= < Some sequences also support “extended slicing” with a third “step” parameter: a[i:j:k] selects all items of a with index x where x = i + nk, n >= 0 and i <= x < j. a[i:j:k] x = i + n*k >= 0 <= < Sequences are distinguished according to their mutability: #### 3. 2. 5. 1. Immutable sequences¶ An object of an immutable sequence type cannot change once it is created. (If the object contains references to other objects, these other objects may be mutable and may be changed; however, the collection of objects directly referenced by an immutable object cannot change. ) The following types are immutable sequences: A string is a sequence of values that represent Unicode code points.",
