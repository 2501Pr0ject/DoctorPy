providing a list of locations to search for modules during import. However, path is typically much more constrained than sys. path. __path__ sys. path __path__ sys. path The same rules used for sys. path also apply to a package’s path. sys. path_hooks (described below) are consulted when traversing a package’s path. sys. path __path__ sys. path_hooks __path__ A package’s init. py file may set or alter the package’s path attribute, and this was typically the way namespace packages were implemented prior to PEP 420. With the adoption of PEP 420, namespace packages no longer need to supply init. py files containing only path manipulation code; the import machinery automatically sets path correctly for the namespace package. __init__. py __path__ __init__. py __path__ __path__ ### 5. 4. 5. Module reprs¶ By default, all modules have a usable repr, however depending on the attributes set above, and in the module’s spec, you can more explicitly control the repr of module objects. If the module has a spec (spec), the import machinery will try to generate a repr from it. If that fails or there is no spec, the import system will craft a default repr using whatever information is available on the module. It will try to use the module. name, module. file, and module. loader as input into the repr, with defaults for whatever information is missing. __spec__ module. __name__ module. __file__ module. __loader__ Here are the exact rules used: If the module has a spec attribute, the information in the spec is used to generate the repr. The “name”, “loader”, “origin”, and “has_location” attributes are consulted. If the module has a spec attribute, the information in the spec is used to generate the repr. The “name”, “loader”, “origin”, and “has_location” attributes are consulted. __spec__ If the module has a file attribute, this is used as part of the module’s repr. If the module has a file attribute, this is used as part of the module’s repr. __file__ If the module has no file but does have a loader that is not None, then the loader’s repr is used as part of the module’s repr.
