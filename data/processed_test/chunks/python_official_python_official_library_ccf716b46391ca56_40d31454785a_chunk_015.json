  "content": "6: Flag constants are now instances of RegexFlag, which is a subclass of enum. IntFlag. RegexFlag enum. IntFlag An enum. IntFlag class containing the regex options listed below. enum. IntFlag Added in version 3. 11: - added to all __all__ Make \\w, \\W, \\b, \\B, \\d, \\D, \\s and \\S perform ASCII-only matching instead of full Unicode matching. This is only meaningful for Unicode (str) patterns, and is ignored for bytes patterns. \\w \\W \\b \\B \\d \\D \\s \\S Corresponds to the inline flag (. a). (. a) Note The U flag still exists for backward compatibility, but is redundant in Python 3 since matches are Unicode by default for str patterns, and Unicode matching isn’t allowed for bytes patterns. UNICODE and the inline flag (. u) are similarly redundant. U str UNICODE (. u) Display debug information about compiled expression. No corresponding inline flag. Perform case-insensitive matching; expressions like [A-Z] will also match lowercase letters. Full Unicode matching (such as Ü matching ü) also works unless the ASCII flag is used to disable non-ASCII matches. The current locale does not change the effect of this flag unless the LOCALE flag is also used. [A-Z] Ü ü ASCII LOCALE Corresponds to the inline flag (. i). (. i) Note that when the Unicode patterns [a-z] or [A-Z] are used in combination with the IGNORECASE flag, they will match the 52 ASCII letters and 4 additional non-ASCII letters: ‘İ’ (U+0130, Latin capital letter I with dot above), ‘ı’ (U+0131, Latin small letter dotless i), ‘ſ’ (U+017F, Latin small letter long s) and ‘K’ (U+212A, Kelvin sign). If the ASCII flag is used, only letters ‘a’ to ‘z’ and ‘A’ to ‘Z’ are matched. [a-z] [A-Z] IGNORECASE ASCII Make \\w, \\W, \\b, \\B and case-insensitive matching dependent on the current locale. This flag can be used only with bytes patterns. \\w \\W \\b \\B Corresponds to the inline flag (. L). (. L) Warning This flag is discouraged; consider Unicode matching instead.",
