  "content": "The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: 1//2 is 0, (-1)//2 is -1, 1//(-2) is -1, and (-1)//(-2) is 0. Also referred to as integer division. For operands of type int, the result has type int. For operands of type float, the result has type float. In general, the result is a whole integer, though the result’s type is not necessarily int. The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: 1//2 is 0, (-1)//2 is -1, 1//(-2) is -1, and (-1)//(-2) is 0. int int float float int 1//2 0 (-1)//2 -1 1//(-2) -1 (-1)//(-2) 0 Not for complex numbers. Instead convert to floats using abs() if appropriate. Not for complex numbers. Instead convert to floats using abs() if appropriate. abs() Conversion from float to int truncates, discarding the fractional part.
