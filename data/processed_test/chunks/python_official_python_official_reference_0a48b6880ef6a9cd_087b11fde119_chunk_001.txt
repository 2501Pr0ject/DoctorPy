Private name manglingÂ¶ When an identifier that textually occurs in a class definition begins with two or more underscore characters and does not end in two or more underscores, it is considered a private name of that class. See also The class specifications. More precisely, private names are transformed to a longer form before code is generated for them. If the transformed name is longer than 255 characters, implementation-defined truncation may happen. The transformation is independent of the syntactical context in which the identifier is used but only the following private identifiers are mangled: Any name used as the name of a variable that is assigned or read or any name of an attribute being accessed. The name attribute of nested functions, classes, and type aliases is however not mangled. Any name used as the name of a variable that is assigned or read or any name of an attribute being accessed. The name attribute of nested functions, classes, and type aliases is however not mangled. __name__ The name of imported modules, e. g. , spam in import __spam. If the module is part of a package (i. e. , its name contains a dot), the name is not mangled, e. g. , the __foo in import __foo. bar is not mangled. The name of imported modules, e. g. , __spam in import __spam. If the module is part of a package (i. e. , its name contains a dot), the name is not mangled, e. g. , the __foo in import __foo. bar is not mangled. __spam import __spam __foo import __foo. bar The name of an imported member, e. g. , __f in from spam import __f. The name of an imported member, e. g. , __f in from spam import __f. __f from spam import __f The transformation rule is defined as follows: The class name, with leading underscores removed and a single leading underscore inserted, is inserted in front of the identifier, e. g. , the identifier __spam occurring in a class named Foo, _Foo or __Foo is transformed to _Foo__spam. The class name, with leading underscores removed and a single leading underscore inserted, is inserted in front of the identifier, e. g. , the identifier __spam occurring in a class named Foo, _Foo or __Foo is transformed to _Foo__spam.
