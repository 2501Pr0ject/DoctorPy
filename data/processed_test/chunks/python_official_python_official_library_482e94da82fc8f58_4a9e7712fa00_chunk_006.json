  "content": "value None When a generator or coroutine function returns, a new StopIteration instance is raised, and the value returned by the function is used as the value parameter to the constructor of the exception. StopIteration value If a generator code directly or indirectly raises StopIteration, it is converted into a RuntimeError (retaining the StopIteration as the new exception’s cause). StopIteration RuntimeError StopIteration Changed in version 3. 3: Added value attribute and the ability for generator functions to use it to return a value. value Changed in version 3. 5: Introduced the RuntimeError transformation via from future import generator_stop, see PEP 479. from __future__ import generator_stop Changed in version 3. 7: Enable PEP 479 for all code by default: a StopIteration error raised in a generator is transformed into a RuntimeError. StopIteration RuntimeError Must be raised by anext() method of an asynchronous iterator object to stop the iteration. __anext__() Added in version 3. 5. Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error. This may occur in an import statement, in a call to the built-in functions compile(), exec(), or eval(), or when reading the initial script or standard input (also interactively). import compile() exec() eval() The str() of the exception instance returns only the error message. Details is a tuple whose members are also available as separate attributes. str() The name of the file the syntax error occurred in. Which line number in the file the error occurred in. This is 1-indexed: the first line in the file has a lineno of 1. lineno The column in the line where the error occurred. This is 1-indexed: the first character in the line has an offset of 1. offset The source code text involved in the error. Which line number in the file the error occurred ends in. This is 1-indexed: the first line in the file has a lineno of 1. lineno The column in the end line where the error occurred finishes. This is 1-indexed: the first character in the line has an offset of 1. offset For errors in f-string fields, the message is prefixed by “f-string: ” and the offsets are offsets in a text constructed from the replacement expression.",
