True posix_spawn POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID_NP NotImplementedError The setsigmask argument will set the signal mask to the signal set specified. If the parameter is not used, then the child inherits the parentâ€™s signal mask. This argument corresponds to the C library POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK flag. POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK The sigdef argument will reset the disposition of all signals in the set specified. This argument corresponds to the C library POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag. POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF The scheduler argument must be a tuple containing the (optional) scheduler policy and an instance of sched_param with the scheduler parameters. A value of None in the place of the scheduler policy indicates that is not being provided. This argument is a combination of the C library POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM and POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER flags. sched_param None POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER Raises an auditing event os. posix_spawn with arguments path, argv, env. os. posix_spawn path argv env Added in version 3. 8. Changed in version 3. 13: env parameter accepts None. os. POSIX_SPAWN_CLOSEFROM is available on platforms where posix_spawn_file_actions_addclosefrom_np() exists. None os. POSIX_SPAWN_CLOSEFROM posix_spawn_file_actions_addclosefrom_np() Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Wraps the posix_spawnp() C library API for use from Python. posix_spawnp() Similar to posix_spawn() except that the system searches for the executable file in the list of directories specified by the PATH environment variable (in the same way as for execvp(3)). posix_spawn() PATH execvp(3) Raises an auditing event os. posix_spawn with arguments path, argv, env. os. posix_spawn path argv env Added in version 3. 8. Availability: POSIX, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. See posix_spawn() documentation. posix_spawn() Register callables to be executed when a new child process is forked using os. fork() or similar process cloning APIs. The parameters are optional and keyword-only. Each specifies a different call point. os. fork() before is a function called before forking a child process. before is a function called before forking a child process.
