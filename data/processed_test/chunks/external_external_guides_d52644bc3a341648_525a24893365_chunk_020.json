  "content": "that it can be embedded inside a larger expression) # Correct: def f(x): return 2*x # Wrong: f = lambda x: 2*x The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is specifically ‘f’ instead of the generic ‘’. This is more useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i. e. that it can be embedded inside a larger expression) Derive exceptions from Exception rather than BaseException. Direct inheritance from BaseException is reserved for exceptions where catching them is almost always the wrong thing to do. Design exception hierarchies based on the distinctions that code catching the exceptions is likely to need, rather than the locations where the exceptions are raised. Aim to answer the question “What went wrong. ” programmatically, rather than only stating that “A problem occurred” (see PEP 3151 for an example of this lesson being learned for the builtin exception hierarchy) Class naming conventions apply here, although you should add the suffix “Error” to your exception classes if the exception is an error. Non-error exceptions that are used for non-local flow control or other forms of signaling need no special suffix.

Non-error exceptions that are used for non-local flow control or other forms of signaling need no special suffix. Use exception chaining appropriately. raise X from Y should be used to indicate explicit replacement without losing the original traceback. When deliberately replacing an inner exception (using raise X from None), ensure that relevant details are transferred to the new exception (such as preserving the attribute name when converting KeyError to AttributeError, or embedding the text of the original exception in the new exception message).",
