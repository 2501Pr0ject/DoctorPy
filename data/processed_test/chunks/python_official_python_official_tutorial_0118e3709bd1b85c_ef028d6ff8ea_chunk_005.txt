The csv module supports direct reading and writing of files in Comma-Separated Value format, commonly supported by databases and spreadsheets. XML processing is supported by the xml. etree. ElementTree, xml. dom and xml. sax packages. Together, these modules and packages greatly simplify data interchange between Python applications and other tools. The json package provides robust support for parsing this popular data interchange format.
