audit() Hooks are added using the sys. addaudithook() or PySys_AddAuditHook() functions. sys. addaudithook() PySys_AddAuditHook() The native equivalent of this function is PySys_Audit(). Using the native function is preferred when possible. PySys_Audit() See the audit events table for all events raised by CPython. Added in version 3. 8. Set during Python startup, before site. py is run, to the same value as exec_prefix. If not running in a virtual environment, the values will stay the same; if site. py finds that a virtual environment is in use, the values of prefix and exec_prefix will be changed to point to the virtual environment, whereas base_prefix and base_exec_prefix will remain pointing to the base Python installation (the one which the virtual environment was created from). site. py exec_prefix site. py prefix exec_prefix base_prefix base_exec_prefix Added in version 3. 3. Set during Python startup, before site. py is run, to the same value as prefix. If not running in a virtual environment, the values will stay the same; if site. py finds that a virtual environment is in use, the values of prefix and exec_prefix will be changed to point to the virtual environment, whereas base_prefix and base_exec_prefix will remain pointing to the base Python installation (the one which the virtual environment was created from). site. py prefix site. py prefix exec_prefix base_prefix base_exec_prefix Added in version 3. 3. An indicator of the native byte order. This will have the value 'big' on big-endian (most-significant byte first) platforms, and 'little' on little-endian (least-significant byte first) platforms. 'big' 'little' A tuple of strings containing the names of all modules that are compiled into this Python interpreter. (This information is not available in any other way â€” modules. keys() only lists the imported modules. ) modules. keys() See also the sys. stdlib_module_names list. sys. stdlib_module_names Call func(args), while tracing is enabled. The tracing state is saved, and restored afterwards. This is intended to be called from a debugger from a checkpoint, to recursively debug or profile some other code. func(*args) Tracing is suspended while calling a tracing function set by settrace() or setprofile() to avoid infinite recursion.
