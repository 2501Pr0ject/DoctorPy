  "content": "There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one: >>> word = 'Python' >>> word[0] # character in position 0 'P' >>> word[5] # character in position 5 'n' Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right: >>> word[-1] # last character 'n' >>> word[-2] # second-last character 'o' >>> word[-6] 'P' Note that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1. In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain a substring: >>> word[0:2] # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded) 'Py' >>> word[2:5] # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded) 'tho' Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced. >>> word[:2] # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded) 'Py' >>> word[4:] # characters from position 4 (included) to the end 'on' >>> word[-2:] # characters from the second-last (included) to the end 'on' Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s: s[:i] + s[i:] s >>> word[:2] + word[2:] 'Python' >>> word[:4] + word[4:] 'Python' One way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has index n, for example: +---+---+---+---+---+---+ | P | y | t | h | o | n | +---+---+---+---+---+---+ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0â€¦6 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices.",
