  "content": "a backslash followed by a space and a newline does not count as a line continuation marker. Some editors don’t preserve it and many projects (like CPython itself) have pre-commit hooks that reject it. Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc. ), comparisons (==, <, >,. =, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not), Booleans (and, or, not). = += -= == < >. = <= >= in not in is is not and or not If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding whitespace around the operators with the lowest priority(ies). Use your own judgment; however, never use more than one space, and always have the same amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator:# Correct: i = i + 1 submitted += 1 x = x2 - 1 hypot2 = xx + yy c = (a+b) * (a-b) # Wrong: i=i+1 submitted +=1 x = x * 2 - 1 hypot2 = x * x + y * y c = (a + b) * (a - b) # Correct: i = i + 1 submitted += 1 x = x*2 - 1 hypot2 = x*x + y*y c = (a+b) * (a-b) # Wrong: i=i+1 submitted +=1 x = x * 2 - 1 hypot2 = x * x + y * y c = (a + b) * (a - b) Function annotations should use the normal rules for colons and always have spaces around the -> arrow if present.

Don’t use spaces around the = sign when used to indicate a keyword argument, or when used to indicate a default value for an unannotated function parameter:# Correct: def complex(real, imag=0.",
