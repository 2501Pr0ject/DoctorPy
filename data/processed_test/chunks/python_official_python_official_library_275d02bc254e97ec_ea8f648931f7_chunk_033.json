  "content": "See also The stat() function. stat() Changed in version 3. 2: Added support for Windows 6. 0 (Vista) symbolic links. Changed in version 3. 3: Added the dir_fd parameter. Changed in version 3. 6: Accepts a path-like object. Changed in version 3. 8: On Windows, now opens reparse points that represent another path (name surrogates), including symbolic links and directory junctions. Other kinds of reparse points are resolved by the operating system as for stat(). stat() Create a directory named path with numeric mode mode. If the directory already exists, FileExistsError is raised. If a parent directory in the path does not exist, FileNotFoundError is raised. FileExistsError FileNotFoundError On some systems, mode is ignored. Where it is used, the current umask value is first masked out. If bits other than the last 9 (i. e. the last 3 digits of the octal representation of the mode) are set, their meaning is platform-dependent. On some platforms, they are ignored and you should call chmod() explicitly to set them. chmod() On Windows, a mode of 0o700 is specifically handled to apply access control to the new directory such that only the current user and administrators have access. Other values of mode are ignored. 0o700 This function can also support paths relative to directory descriptors. It is also possible to create temporary directories; see the tempfile module’s tempfile. mkdtemp() function. tempfile tempfile. mkdtemp() Raises an auditing event os. mkdir with arguments path, mode, dir_fd. os. mkdir path mode dir_fd Changed in version 3. 3: Added the dir_fd parameter. Changed in version 3. 6: Accepts a path-like object. Changed in version 3. 13: Windows now handles a mode of 0o700. 0o700 Recursive directory creation function. Like mkdir(), but makes all intermediate-level directories needed to contain the leaf directory. mkdir() The mode parameter is passed to mkdir() for creating the leaf directory; see the mkdir() description for how it is interpreted. To set the file permission bits of any newly created parent directories you can set the umask before invoking makedirs(). The file permission bits of existing parent directories are not changed.",
