IndexError KeyError Implement checking for unused arguments if desired. The arguments to this function is the set of all argument keys that were actually referred to in the format string (integers for positional arguments, and strings for named arguments), and a reference to the args and kwargs that was passed to vformat. The set of unused args can be calculated from these parameters. check_unused_args() is assumed to raise an exception if the check fails. check_unused_args() format_field() simply calls the global format() built-in. The method is provided so that subclasses can override it. format_field() format() Converts the value (returned by get_field()) given a conversion type (as in the tuple returned by the parse() method). The default version understands ‘s’ (str), ‘r’ (repr) and ‘a’ (ascii) conversion types. get_field() parse() ## Format String Syntax¶ The str. format() method and the Formatter class share the same syntax for format strings (although in the case of Formatter, subclasses can define their own format string syntax). The syntax is related to that of formatted string literals, but it is less sophisticated and, in particular, does not support arbitrary expressions. str. format() Formatter Formatter Format strings contain “replacement fields” surrounded by curly braces {}. Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: {{ and }}. {} {{ }} The grammar for a replacement field is as follows: replacement_field ::= "{" [field_name] [". " conversion] [":" format_spec] "}" field_name ::= arg_name (". " attribute_name | "[" element_index "]")* arg_name ::= [identifier | digit+] attribute_name ::= identifier element_index ::= digit+ | index_string index_string ::= <any source character except "]"> + conversion ::= "r" | "s" | "a" format_spec ::= format-spec:format_spec field_name conversion format_spec arg_name attribute_name element_index identifier digit identifier digit index_string format-spec:format_spec In less formal terms, the replacement field can start with a field_name that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted and inserted into the output instead of the replacement field. The field_name is optionally followed by a conversion field, which is preceded by an exclamation point '. ', and a format_spec, which is preceded by a colon ':'.
