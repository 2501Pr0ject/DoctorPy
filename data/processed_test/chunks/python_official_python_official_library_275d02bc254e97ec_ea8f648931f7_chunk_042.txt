d_type == DT_UNKNOWN This method can raise OSError, such as PermissionError, but FileNotFoundError is caught and not raised. OSError PermissionError FileNotFoundError Return True if this entry is a junction (even if broken); return False if the entry points to a regular directory, any kind of file, a symlink, or if it doesnâ€™t exist anymore. True False The result is cached on the os. DirEntry object. Call os. path. isjunction() to fetch up-to-date information. os. DirEntry os. path. isjunction() Added in version 3. 12. Return a stat_result object for this entry. This method follows symbolic links by default; to stat a symbolic link add the follow_symlinks=False argument. stat_result follow_symlinks=False On Unix, this method always requires a system call. On Windows, it only requires a system call if follow_symlinks is True and the entry is a reparse point (for example, a symbolic link or directory junction). True On Windows, the st_ino, st_dev and st_nlink attributes of the stat_result are always set to zero. Call os. stat() to get these attributes. st_ino st_dev st_nlink stat_result os. stat() The result is cached on the os. DirEntry object, with a separate cache for follow_symlinks True and False. Call os. stat() to fetch up-to-date information. os. DirEntry True False os. stat() Note that there is a nice correspondence between several attributes and methods of os. DirEntry and of pathlib. Path. In particular, the name attribute has the same meaning, as do the is_dir(), is_file(), is_symlink(), is_junction(), and stat() methods. os. DirEntry pathlib. Path name is_dir() is_file() is_symlink() is_junction() stat() Added in version 3. 5. Changed in version 3. 6: Added support for the PathLike interface. Added support for bytes paths on Windows. PathLike bytes Changed in version 3. 12: The st_ctime attribute of a stat result is deprecated on Windows. The file creation time is properly available as st_birthtime, and in the future st_ctime may be changed to return zero or the metadata change time, if available. st_ctime st_birthtime st_ctime Get the status of a file or a file descriptor.
