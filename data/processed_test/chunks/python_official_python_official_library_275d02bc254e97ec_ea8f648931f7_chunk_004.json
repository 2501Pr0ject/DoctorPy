Use environb if you would like to use a different encoding. sys. getfilesystemencoding() 'surrogateescape' environb On Windows, the keys are converted to uppercase. This also applies when getting, setting, or deleting an item. For example, environ['monty'] = 'python' maps the key 'MONTY' to the value 'python'. environ['monty'] = 'python' 'MONTY' 'python' Note Calling putenv() directly does not change os. environ, so it’s better to modify os. environ. putenv() os. environ os. environ Note On some platforms, including FreeBSD and macOS, setting environ may cause memory leaks.
