If the object is a type or class object, the list contains the names of its attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its bases. Otherwise, the list contains the object’s attributes’ names, the names of its class’s attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its class’s base classes. Otherwise, the list contains the object’s attributes’ names, the names of its class’s attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its class’s base classes. The resulting list is sorted alphabetically. For example: >>> import struct >>> dir() # show the names in the module namespace ['__builtins__', '__name__', 'struct'] >>> dir(struct) # show the names in the struct module ['Struct', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__initializing__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '_clearcache', 'calcsize', 'error', 'pack', 'pack_into', 'unpack', 'unpack_from'] >>> class Shape:. def __dir__(self):. return ['area', 'perimeter', 'location']. >>> s = Shape() >>> dir(s) ['area', 'location', 'perimeter'] Note Because dir() is supplied primarily as a convenience for use at an interactive prompt, it tries to supply an interesting set of names more than it tries to supply a rigorously or consistently defined set of names, and its detailed behavior may change across releases. For example, metaclass attributes are not in the result list when the argument is a class. dir() Take two (non-complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder when using integer division. With mixed operand types, the rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For integers, the result is the same as (a // b, a % b). For floating-point numbers the result is (q, a % b), where q is usually math. floor(a / b) but may be 1 less than that. In any case q * b + a % b is very close to a, if a % b is non-zero it has the same sign as b, and 0 <= abs(a % b) < abs(b). (a // b, a % b) (q, a % b) math. floor(a / b) q * b + a % b a % b 0 <= abs(a % b) < abs(b) Return an enumerate object.
