' in os. py. Also available via os. path. '. ' os. py os. path The character conventionally used by the operating system to separate search path components (as in PATH), such as ':' for POSIX or ';' for Windows. Also available via os. path. PATH ':' ';' os. path The default search path used by execp and spawnp if the environment doesn’t have a 'PATH' key. Also available via os. path. exec*p* spawn*p* 'PATH' os. path The string used to separate (or, rather, terminate) lines on the current platform. This may be a single character, such as '\n' for POSIX, or multiple characters, for example, '\r\n' for Windows. Do not use os. linesep as a line terminator when writing files opened in text mode (the default); use a single '\n' instead, on all platforms. '\n' '\r\n' '\n' The file path of the null device. For example: '/dev/null' for POSIX, 'nul' for Windows. Also available via os. path. '/dev/null' 'nul' os. path Flags for use with the setdlopenflags() and getdlopenflags() functions. See the Unix manual page dlopen(3) for what the different flags mean. setdlopenflags() getdlopenflags() Added in version 3. 3. ## Random numbers¶ Get up to size random bytes. The function can return less bytes than requested. These bytes can be used to seed user-space random number generators or for cryptographic purposes. getrandom() relies on entropy gathered from device drivers and other sources of environmental noise. Unnecessarily reading large quantities of data will have a negative impact on other users of the /dev/random and /dev/urandom devices. getrandom() /dev/random /dev/urandom The flags argument is a bit mask that can contain zero or more of the following values ORed together: os. GRND_RANDOM and GRND_NONBLOCK. os. GRND_RANDOM GRND_NONBLOCK See also the Linux getrandom() manual page. Availability: Linux >= 3. 17. Added in version 3. 6. Return a bytestring of size random bytes suitable for cryptographic use. This function returns random bytes from an OS-specific randomness source.
