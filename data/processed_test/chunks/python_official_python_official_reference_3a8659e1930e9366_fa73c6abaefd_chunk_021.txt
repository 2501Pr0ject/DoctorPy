Special read-only attributes¶ Points to the previous stack frame (towards the caller), or None if this is the bottom stack frame None The code object being executed in this frame. Accessing this attribute raises an auditing event object. getattr with arguments obj and "f_code". object. __getattr__ obj "f_code" The mapping used by the frame to look up local variables. If the frame refers to an optimized scope, this may return a write-through proxy object. Changed in version 3. 13: Return a proxy for optimized scopes. The dictionary used by the frame to look up global variables The dictionary used by the frame to look up built-in (intrinsic) names The “precise instruction” of the frame object (this is an index into the bytecode string of the code object) ##### 3. 2. 13. 2. 2. Special writable attributes¶ If not None, this is a function called for various events during code execution (this is used by debuggers). Normally an event is triggered for each new source line (see f_trace_lines). None f_trace_lines Set this attribute to False to disable triggering a tracing event for each source line. False Set this attribute to True to allow per-opcode events to be requested. Note that this may lead to undefined interpreter behaviour if exceptions raised by the trace function escape to the function being traced. True The current line number of the frame – writing to this from within a trace function jumps to the given line (only for the bottom-most frame). A debugger can implement a Jump command (aka Set Next Statement) by writing to this attribute. ##### 3. 2. 13. 2. 3. Frame object methods¶ Frame objects support one method: This method clears all references to local variables held by the frame. Also, if the frame belonged to a generator, the generator is finalized. This helps break reference cycles involving frame objects (for example when catching an exception and storing its traceback for later use). RuntimeError is raised if the frame is currently executing or suspended. RuntimeError Added in version 3. 4. Changed in version 3. 13: Attempting to clear a suspended frame raises RuntimeError (as has always been the case for executing frames). RuntimeError #### 3. 2. 13. 3. Traceback objects¶ Traceback objects represent the stack trace of an exception.
