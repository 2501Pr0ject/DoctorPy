Boolean operations¶ or_test ::= and_test | or_test "or" and_test and_test ::= not_test | and_test "and" not_test not_test ::= comparison | "not" not_test and_test or_test and_test not_test and_test not_test comparison not_test In the context of Boolean operations, and also when expressions are used by control flow statements, the following values are interpreted as false: False, None, numeric zero of all types, and empty strings and containers (including strings, tuples, lists, dictionaries, sets and frozensets). All other values are interpreted as true. User-defined objects can customize their truth value by providing a bool() method. False None __bool__() The operator not yields True if its argument is false, False otherwise. not True False The expression x and y first evaluates x; if x is false, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned. x and y The expression x or y first evaluates x; if x is true, its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and the resulting value is returned. x or y Note that neither and nor or restrict the value and type they return to False and True, but rather return the last evaluated argument. This is sometimes useful, e. g. , if s is a string that should be replaced by a default value if it is empty, the expression s or 'foo' yields the desired value. Because not has to create a new value, it returns a boolean value regardless of the type of its argument (for example, not 'foo' produces False rather than ''. ) and or False True s s or 'foo' not not 'foo' False '' ## 6. 12. Assignment expressions¶ assignment_expression ::= [identifier ":="] expression identifier expression An assignment expression (sometimes also called a “named expression” or “walrus”) assigns an expression to an identifier, while also returning the value of the expression. expression identifier expression One common use case is when handling matched regular expressions: if matching := pattern. search(data): do_something(matching) Or, when processing a file stream in chunks: while chunk := file. read(9000): process(chunk) Assignment expressions must be surrounded by parentheses when used as expression statements and when used as sub-expressions in slicing, conditional, lambda, keyword-argument, and comprehension-if expressions and in assert, with, and assignment statements.
