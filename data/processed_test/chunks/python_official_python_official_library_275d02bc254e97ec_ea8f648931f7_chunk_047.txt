st_rdev st_dev Added the st_birthtime member on Windows. st_birthtime Perform a statvfs() system call on the given path. The return value is an object whose attributes describe the filesystem on the given path, and correspond to the members of the statvfs structure, namely: f_bsize, f_frsize, f_blocks, f_bfree, f_bavail, f_files, f_ffree, f_favail, f_flag, f_namemax, f_fsid. statvfs() statvfs f_bsize f_frsize f_blocks f_bfree f_bavail f_files f_ffree f_favail f_flag f_namemax f_fsid Two module-level constants are defined for the f_flag attributeâ€™s bit-flags: if ST_RDONLY is set, the filesystem is mounted read-only, and if ST_NOSUID is set, the semantics of setuid/setgid bits are disabled or not supported. f_flag ST_RDONLY ST_NOSUID Additional module-level constants are defined for GNU/glibc based systems. These are ST_NODEV (disallow access to device special files), ST_NOEXEC (disallow program execution), ST_SYNCHRONOUS (writes are synced at once), ST_MANDLOCK (allow mandatory locks on an FS), ST_WRITE (write on file/directory/symlink), ST_APPEND (append-only file), ST_IMMUTABLE (immutable file), ST_NOATIME (do not update access times), ST_NODIRATIME (do not update directory access times), ST_RELATIME (update atime relative to mtime/ctime). ST_NODEV ST_NOEXEC ST_SYNCHRONOUS ST_MANDLOCK ST_WRITE ST_APPEND ST_IMMUTABLE ST_NOATIME ST_NODIRATIME ST_RELATIME This function can support specifying a file descriptor. Availability: Unix. Changed in version 3. 2: The ST_RDONLY and ST_NOSUID constants were added. ST_RDONLY ST_NOSUID Changed in version 3. 3: Added support for specifying path as an open file descriptor. Changed in version 3. 4: The ST_NODEV, ST_NOEXEC, ST_SYNCHRONOUS, ST_MANDLOCK, ST_WRITE, ST_APPEND, ST_IMMUTABLE, ST_NOATIME, ST_NODIRATIME, and ST_RELATIME constants were added.
