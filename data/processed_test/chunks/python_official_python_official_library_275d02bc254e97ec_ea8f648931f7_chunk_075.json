  "content": "At least one of WEXITED, WSTOPPED or WCONTINUED is required; WNOHANG and WNOWAIT are additional optional flags. WEXITED WSTOPPED WCONTINUED WNOHANG WNOWAIT The return value is an object representing the data contained in the siginfo_t structure with the following attributes: siginfo_t si_pid (process ID) si_pid (process ID) si_pid si_uid (real user ID of the child) si_uid (real user ID of the child) si_uid si_signo (always SIGCHLD) si_signo (always SIGCHLD) si_signo SIGCHLD si_status (the exit status or signal number, depending on si_code) si_status (the exit status or signal number, depending on si_code) si_status si_code si_code (see CLD_EXITED for possible values) si_code (see CLD_EXITED for possible values) si_code CLD_EXITED If WNOHANG is specified and there are no matching children in the requested state, None is returned. Otherwise, if there are no matching children that could be waited for, ChildProcessError is raised. WNOHANG None ChildProcessError Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Added in version 3. 3. Changed in version 3. 13: This function is now available on macOS as well. The details of this function differ on Unix and Windows. On Unix: Wait for completion of a child process given by process id pid, and return a tuple containing its process id and exit status indication (encoded as for wait()). The semantics of the call are affected by the value of the integer options, which should be 0 for normal operation. wait() 0 If pid is greater than 0, waitpid() requests status information for that specific process. If pid is 0, the request is for the status of any child in the process group of the current process. If pid is -1, the request pertains to any child of the current process. If pid is less than -1, status is requested for any process in the process group -pid (the absolute value of pid). 0 waitpid() 0 -1 -1 -pid options is an OR combination of flags. If it contains WNOHANG and there are no matching children in the requested state, (0, 0) is returned.",
