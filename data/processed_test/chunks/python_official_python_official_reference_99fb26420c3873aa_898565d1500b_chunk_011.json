  "content": "String literal concatenation¶ Multiple adjacent string or bytes literals (delimited by whitespace), possibly using different quoting conventions, are allowed, and their meaning is the same as their concatenation. Thus, \"hello\" 'world' is equivalent to \"helloworld\". This feature can be used to reduce the number of backslashes needed, to split long strings conveniently across long lines, or even to add comments to parts of strings, for example: \"hello\" 'world' \"helloworld\" re. compile(\"[A-Za-z_]\" # letter or underscore \"[A-Za-z0-9_]*\" # letter, digit or underscore ) Note that this feature is defined at the syntactical level, but implemented at compile time. The ‘+’ operator must be used to concatenate string expressions at run time. Also note that literal concatenation can use different quoting styles for each component (even mixing raw strings and triple quoted strings), and formatted string literals may be concatenated with plain string literals. ### 2. 4. 3. f-strings¶ Added in version 3. 6. A formatted string literal or f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with 'f' or 'F'. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces {}. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time. 'f' 'F' {} Escape sequences are decoded like in ordinary string literals (except when a literal is also marked as a raw string). After decoding, the grammar for the contents of the string is: f_string ::= (literal_char | \"{{\" | \"}}\" | replacement_field)* replacement_field ::= \"{\" f_expression [\"=\"] [\". \" conversion] [\":\" format_spec] \"}\" f_expression ::= (conditional_expression | \"*\" or_expr) (\",\" conditional_expression | \",\" \"*\" or_expr)* [\",\"] | yield_expression conversion ::= \"s\" | \"r\" | \"a\" format_spec ::= (literal_char | replacement_field)* literal_char ::= <any code point except \"{\", \"}\" or NULL> literal_char replacement_field f_expression conversion format_spec conditional_expression or_expr conditional_expression or_expr yield_expression literal_char replacement_field The parts of the string outside curly braces are treated literally, except that any doubled curly braces '{{' or '}}' are replaced with the corresponding single curly brace. A single opening curly bracket '{' marks a replacement field, which starts with a Python expression.",
