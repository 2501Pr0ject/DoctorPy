  "content": "mkdir() makedirs() If exist_ok is False (the default), a FileExistsError is raised if the target directory already exists. False FileExistsError Note makedirs() will become confused if the path elements to create include pardir (eg. “. ” on UNIX systems). makedirs() pardir This function handles UNC paths correctly. Raises an auditing event os. mkdir with arguments path, mode, dir_fd. os. mkdir path mode dir_fd Changed in version 3. 2: Added the exist_ok parameter. Changed in version 3. 4. 1: Before Python 3. 4. 1, if exist_ok was True and the directory existed, makedirs() would still raise an error if mode did not match the mode of the existing directory. Since this behavior was impossible to implement safely, it was removed in Python 3. 4. 1. See bpo-21082. True makedirs() Changed in version 3. 6: Accepts a path-like object. Changed in version 3. 7: The mode argument no longer affects the file permission bits of newly created intermediate-level directories. Create a FIFO (a named pipe) named path with numeric mode mode. The current umask value is first masked out from the mode. This function can also support paths relative to directory descriptors. FIFOs are pipes that can be accessed like regular files. FIFOs exist until they are deleted (for example with os. unlink()). Generally, FIFOs are used as rendezvous between “client” and “server” type processes: the server opens the FIFO for reading, and the client opens it for writing. Note that mkfifo() doesn’t open the FIFO — it just creates the rendezvous point. os. unlink() mkfifo() Availability: Unix, not WASI. Changed in version 3. 3: Added the dir_fd parameter. Changed in version 3. 6: Accepts a path-like object. Create a filesystem node (file, device special file or named pipe) named path. mode specifies both the permissions to use and the type of node to be created, being combined (bitwise OR) with one of stat. S_IFREG, stat. S_IFCHR, stat. S_IFBLK, and stat. S_IFIFO (those constants are available in stat). For stat. S_IFCHR and stat.",
