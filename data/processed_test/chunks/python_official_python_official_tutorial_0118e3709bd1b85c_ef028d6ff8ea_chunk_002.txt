random() # random float from the interval [0. 0, 1. 0) 0. 17970987693706186 >>> random. randrange(6) # random integer chosen from range(6) 4 The statistics module calculates basic statistical properties (the mean, median, variance, etc. ) of numeric data: statistics >>> import statistics >>> data = [2. 75, 1. 75, 1. 25, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 25, 3. 5] >>> statistics. mean(data) 1. 6071428571428572 >>> statistics. median(data) 1. 25 >>> statistics. variance(data) 1. 3720238095238095 The SciPy project  has many other modules for numerical computations. ## 10. 7. Internet Access¶ There are a number of modules for accessing the internet and processing internet protocols. Two of the simplest are urllib. request for retrieving data from URLs and smtplib for sending mail: urllib. request smtplib >>> from urllib. request import urlopen >>> with urlopen(' as response:. for line in response:. line = line. decode() # Convert bytes to a str. if line. startswith('datetime'):. print(line. rstrip()) # Remove trailing newline. datetime: 2022-01-01T01:36:47. 689215+00:00 >>> import smtplib >>> server = smtplib. SMTP('localhost') >>> server. sendmail('soothsayer@example. org', 'jcaesar@example. org',. """To: jcaesar@example. org. From: soothsayer@example. org. Beware the Ides of March. """) >>> server. quit() (Note that the second example needs a mailserver running on localhost. ) ## 10. 8. Dates and Times¶ The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient member extraction for output formatting and manipulation. The module also supports objects that are timezone aware. datetime >>> # dates are easily constructed and formatted >>> from datetime import date >>> now = date. today() >>> now datetime. date(2003, 12, 2) >>> now. strftime("%m-%d-%y.
