PYTHONIOENCODING As a consequence of the changes in those lower level APIs, other higher level APIs also exhibit different default behaviours: Command line arguments, environment variables and filenames are decoded to text using the UTF-8 encoding. Command line arguments, environment variables and filenames are decoded to text using the UTF-8 encoding. os. fsdecode() and os. fsencode() use the UTF-8 encoding. os. fsdecode() and os. fsencode() use the UTF-8 encoding. os. fsdecode() os. fsencode() open(), io. open(), and codecs. open() use the UTF-8 encoding by default.",
