Methods of File Objects¶ The rest of the examples in this section will assume that a file object called f has already been created. f To read a file’s contents, call f. read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned; it’s your problem if the file is twice as large as your machine’s memory. Otherwise, at most size characters (in text mode) or size bytes (in binary mode) are read and returned. If the end of the file has been reached, f. read() will return an empty string (''). f. read(size) f. read() '' >>> f. read() 'This is the entire file. \\n' >>> f. read() '' f. readline() reads a single line from the file; a newline character (\\n) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the last line of the file if the file doesn’t end in a newline. This makes the return value unambiguous; if f.",
