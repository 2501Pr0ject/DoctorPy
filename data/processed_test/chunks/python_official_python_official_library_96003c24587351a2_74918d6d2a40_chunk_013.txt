OverflowError For a general Python object x, float(x) delegates to x. float(). If float() is not defined then it falls back to index(). x float(x) x. __float__() __float__() __index__() If no argument is given, 0. 0 is returned. 0. 0 The float type is described in Numeric Types — int, float, complex. Changed in version 3. 6: Grouping digits with underscores as in code literals is allowed. Changed in version 3. 7: The parameter is now positional-only. Changed in version 3. 8: Falls back to index() if float() is not defined. __index__() __float__() Convert a value to a “formatted” representation, as controlled by format_spec. The interpretation of format_spec will depend on the type of the value argument; however, there is a standard formatting syntax that is used by most built-in types: Format Specification Mini-Language. The default format_spec is an empty string which usually gives the same effect as calling str(value). str(value) A call to format(value, format_spec) is translated to type(value). format(value, format_spec) which bypasses the instance dictionary when searching for the value’s format() method. A TypeError exception is raised if the method search reaches object and the format_spec is non-empty, or if either the format_spec or the return value are not strings. format(value, format_spec) type(value). __format__(value, format_spec) __format__() TypeError object Changed in version 3. 4: object(). format(format_spec) raises TypeError if format_spec is not an empty string. object(). __format__(format_spec) TypeError Return a new frozenset object, optionally with elements taken from iterable. frozenset is a built-in class. See frozenset and Set Types — set, frozenset for documentation about this class. frozenset frozenset frozenset For other containers see the built-in set, list, tuple, and dict classes, as well as the collections module. set list tuple dict collections Return the value of the named attribute of object. name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the object’s attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example, getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to x. foobar.
