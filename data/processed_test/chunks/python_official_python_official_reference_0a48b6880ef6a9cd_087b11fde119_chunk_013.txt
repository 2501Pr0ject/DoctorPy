Attribute references¶ An attribute reference is a primary followed by a period and a name: attributeref ::= primary ". " identifier primary identifier The primary must evaluate to an object of a type that supports attribute references, which most objects do. This object is then asked to produce the attribute whose name is the identifier. The type and value produced is determined by the object. Multiple evaluations of the same attribute reference may yield different objects. This production can be customized by overriding the getattribute() method or the getattr() method. The getattribute() method is called first and either returns a value or raises AttributeError if the attribute is not available. __getattribute__() __getattr__() __getattribute__() AttributeError If an AttributeError is raised and the object has a getattr() method, that method is called as a fallback. AttributeError __getattr__() ### 6. 3. 2. Subscriptions¶ The subscription of an instance of a container class will generally select an element from the container. The subscription of a generic class will generally return a GenericAlias object. subscription ::= primary "[" flexible_expression_list "]" primary flexible_expression_list When an object is subscripted, the interpreter will evaluate the primary and the expression list. The primary must evaluate to an object that supports subscription. An object may support subscription through defining one or both of getitem() and class_getitem(). When the primary is subscripted, the evaluated result of the expression list will be passed to one of these methods. For more details on when class_getitem is called instead of getitem, see class_getitem versus getitem. __getitem__() __class_getitem__() __class_getitem__ __getitem__ If the expression list contains at least one comma, or if any of the expressions are starred, the expression list will evaluate to a tuple containing the items of the expression list. Otherwise, the expression list will evaluate to the value of the list’s sole member. tuple Changed in version 3. 11: Expressions in an expression list may be starred. See PEP 646. For built-in objects, there are two types of objects that support subscription via getitem(): __getitem__() Mappings. If the primary is a mapping, the expression list must evaluate to an object whose value is one of the keys of the mapping, and the subscription selects the value in the mapping that corresponds to that key. An example of a builtin mapping class is the dict class. Mappings.
