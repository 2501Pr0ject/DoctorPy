  "content": "Return the name of the slave pseudo-terminal device associated with the master pseudo-terminal device to which the file descriptor fd refers. The file descriptor fd is not closed upon failure. Calls the reentrant C standard library function ptsname_r() if it is available; otherwise, the C standard library function ptsname(), which is not guaranteed to be thread-safe, is called. ptsname_r() ptsname() Availability: Unix, not WASI. Added in version 3. 13. Write the bytestring in str to file descriptor fd at position of offset, leaving the file offset unchanged. Return the number of bytes actually written. Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. Write the buffers contents to file descriptor fd at an offset offset, leaving the file offset unchanged. buffers must be a sequence of bytes-like objects. Buffers are processed in array order. Entire contents of the first buffer is written before proceeding to the second, and so on. The flags argument contains a bitwise OR of zero or more of the following flags: RWF_DSYNC RWF_DSYNC RWF_DSYNC RWF_SYNC RWF_SYNC RWF_SYNC RWF_APPEND RWF_APPEND RWF_APPEND Return the total number of bytes actually written. The operating system may set a limit (sysconf() value 'SC_IOV_MAX') on the number of buffers that can be used. sysconf() 'SC_IOV_MAX' Combine the functionality of os. writev() and os. pwrite(). os. writev() os. pwrite() Availability: Linux >= 2. 6. 30, FreeBSD >= 6. 0, OpenBSD >= 2. 7, AIX >= 7. 1. Using flags requires Linux >= 4. 6. Added in version 3. 7. Provide a per-write equivalent of the O_DSYNC os. open() flag. This flag effect applies only to the data range written by the system call. O_DSYNC os. open() Availability: Linux >= 4. 7. Added in version 3. 7. Provide a per-write equivalent of the O_SYNC os. open() flag. This flag effect applies only to the data range written by the system call. O_SYNC os. open() Availability: Linux >= 4. 7. Added in version 3. 7.
