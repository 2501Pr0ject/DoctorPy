  "content": "Whitespace is needed between two tokens only if their concatenation could otherwise be interpreted as a different token (e. g. , ab is one token, but a b is two tokens). ## 2. 2. Other tokens¶ Besides NEWLINE, INDENT and DEDENT, the following categories of tokens exist: identifiers, keywords, literals, operators, and delimiters. Whitespace characters (other than line terminators, discussed earlier) are not tokens, but serve to delimit tokens. Where ambiguity exists, a token comprises the longest possible string that forms a legal token, when read from left to right. ## 2. 3. Identifiers and keywords¶ Identifiers (also referred to as names) are described by the following lexical definitions. The syntax of identifiers in Python is based on the Unicode standard annex UAX-31, with elaboration and changes as defined below; see also PEP 3131 for further details. Within the ASCII range (U+0001. U+007F), the valid characters for identifiers include the uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z, the underscore _ and, except for the first character, the digits 0 through 9. Python 3. 0 introduced additional characters from outside the ASCII range (see PEP 3131). For these characters, the classification uses the version of the Unicode Character Database as included in the unicodedata module. A Z _ 0 9 unicodedata Identifiers are unlimited in length. Case is significant.",
