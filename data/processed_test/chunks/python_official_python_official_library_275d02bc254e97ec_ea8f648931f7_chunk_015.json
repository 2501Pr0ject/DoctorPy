  "content": "5: Added support for Windows Get the blocking mode of the file descriptor: False if the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, True if the flag is cleared. False O_NONBLOCK True See also set_blocking() and socket. socket. setblocking(). set_blocking() socket. socket. setblocking() Availability: Unix, Windows. The function is limited on WASI, see WebAssembly platforms for more information. On Windows, this function is limited to pipes. Added in version 3. 5. Changed in version 3. 12: Added support for pipes on Windows. Grant access to the slave pseudo-terminal device associated with the master pseudo-terminal device to which the file descriptor fd refers. The file descriptor fd is not closed upon failure. Calls the C standard library function grantpt(). grantpt() Availability: Unix, not WASI. Added in version 3. 13. Return True if the file descriptor fd is open and connected to a tty(-like) device, else False. True False Apply, test or remove a POSIX lock on an open file descriptor. fd is an open file descriptor. cmd specifies the command to use - one of F_LOCK, F_TLOCK, F_ULOCK or F_TEST. len specifies the section of the file to lock. F_LOCK F_TLOCK F_ULOCK F_TEST Raises an auditing event os. lockf with arguments fd, cmd, len. os. lockf fd cmd len Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. Flags that specify what action lockf() will take. lockf() Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. Prepare the tty of which fd is a file descriptor for a new login session. Make the calling process a session leader; make the tty the controlling tty, the stdin, the stdout, and the stderr of the calling process; close fd. Availability: Unix, not WASI. Added in version 3. 11. Set the current position of file descriptor fd to position pos, modified by whence, and return the new position in bytes relative to the start of the file.",
