The operating system may set a limit (sysconf() value 'SC_IOV_MAX') on the number of buffers that can be used. sysconf() 'SC_IOV_MAX' Availability: Unix. Added in version 3. 3. ### Querying the size of a terminal¶ Added in version 3. 3. Return the size of the terminal window as (columns, lines), tuple of type terminal_size. (columns, lines) terminal_size The optional argument fd (default STDOUT_FILENO, or standard output) specifies which file descriptor should be queried. fd STDOUT_FILENO If the file descriptor is not connected to a terminal, an OSError is raised. OSError shutil. get_terminal_size() is the high-level function which should normally be used, os. get_terminal_size is the low-level implementation. shutil. get_terminal_size() os. get_terminal_size Availability: Unix, Windows. A subclass of tuple, holding (columns, lines) of the terminal window size. (columns, lines) Width of the terminal window in characters. Height of the terminal window in characters. ### Inheritance of File Descriptors¶ Added in version 3. 4. A file descriptor has an “inheritable” flag which indicates if the file descriptor can be inherited by child processes. Since Python 3. 4, file descriptors created by Python are non-inheritable by default. On UNIX, non-inheritable file descriptors are closed in child processes at the execution of a new program, other file descriptors are inherited. On Windows, non-inheritable handles and file descriptors are closed in child processes, except for standard streams (file descriptors 0, 1 and 2: stdin, stdout and stderr), which are always inherited. Using spawn functions, all inheritable handles and all inheritable file descriptors are inherited. Using the subprocess module, all file descriptors except standard streams are closed, and inheritable handles are only inherited if the close_fds parameter is False. spawn* subprocess False On WebAssembly platforms, the file descriptor cannot be modified. Get the “inheritable” flag of the specified file descriptor (a boolean). Set the “inheritable” flag of the specified file descriptor. Get the “inheritable” flag of the specified handle (a boolean). Availability: Windows. Set the “inheritable” flag of the specified handle. Availability: Windows.
