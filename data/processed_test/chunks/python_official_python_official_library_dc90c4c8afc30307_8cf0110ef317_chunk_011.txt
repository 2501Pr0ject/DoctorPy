atan(y / x) -pi pi (x, y) atan2() atan(1) atan2(1, 1) pi/4 atan2(-1, -1) -3*pi/4 Return the cosine of x radians. Return the sine of x radians. Return the tangent of x radians. ## Hyperbolic functions¶ Hyperbolic functions are analogs of trigonometric functions that are based on hyperbolas instead of circles. Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x. Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of x. Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x. Return the hyperbolic cosine of x. Return the hyperbolic sine of x. Return the hyperbolic tangent of x. ## Special functions¶ Return the error function at x. The erf() function can be used to compute traditional statistical functions such as the cumulative standard normal distribution: erf() def phi(x): 'Cumulative distribution function for the standard normal distribution' return (1. 0 + erf(x / sqrt(2. 0))) / 2. 0 Added in version 3. 2. Return the complementary error function at x. The complementary error function is defined as 1. 0 - erf(x). It is used for large values of x where a subtraction from one would cause a loss of significance. 1. 0 - erf(x) Added in version 3. 2. Return the Gamma function at x. Added in version 3. 2. Return the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma function at x. Added in version 3. 2. ## Constants¶ The mathematical constant π = 3. 141592…, to available precision. The mathematical constant e = 2. 718281…, to available precision. The mathematical constant τ = 6. 283185…, to available precision. Tau is a circle constant equal to 2π, the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius. To learn more about Tau, check out Vi Hart’s video Pi is (still) Wrong, and start celebrating Tau day by eating twice as much pie. Added in version 3. 6. A floating-point positive infinity. (For negative infinity, use -math. inf. ) Equivalent to the output of float('inf'). -math. inf float('inf') Added in version 3. 5.
