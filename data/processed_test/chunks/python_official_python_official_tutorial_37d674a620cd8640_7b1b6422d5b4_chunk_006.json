We’ll find other uses for del later. a del ## 5. 3. Tuples and Sequences¶ We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance: >>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello. ' >>> t[0] 12345 >>> t (12345, 54321, 'hello. ') >>> # Tuples may be nested: >>> u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) >>> u ((12345, 54321, 'hello. '), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) >>> # Tuples are immutable: >>> t[0] = 88888 Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment >>> # but they can contain mutable objects: >>> v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) >>> v ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists. Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different purposes.",
