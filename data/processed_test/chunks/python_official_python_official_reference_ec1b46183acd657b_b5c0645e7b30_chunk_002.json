  "content": "starred_list else A break statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop without executing the else clause’s suite. A continue statement executed in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and continues with the next item, or with the else clause if there is no next item. break else continue else The for-loop makes assignments to the variables in the target list. This overwrites all previous assignments to those variables including those made in the suite of the for-loop: for i in range(10): print(i) i = 5 # this will not affect the for-loop # because i will be overwritten with the next # index in the range Names in the target list are not deleted when the loop is finished, but if the sequence is empty, they will not have been assigned to at all by the loop. Hint: the built-in type range() represents immutable arithmetic sequences of integers. For instance, iterating range(3) successively yields 0, 1, and then 2. range() range(3) Changed in version 3. 11: Starred elements are now allowed in the expression list. ## 8. 4. The try statement¶ try The try statement specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements: try try_stmt ::= try1_stmt | try2_stmt | try3_stmt try1_stmt ::= \"try\" \":\" suite (\"except\" [expression [\"as\" identifier]] \":\" suite)+ [\"else\" \":\" suite] [\"finally\" \":\" suite] try2_stmt ::= \"try\" \":\" suite (\"except\" \"*\" expression [\"as\" identifier] \":\" suite)+ [\"else\" \":\" suite] [\"finally\" \":\" suite] try3_stmt ::= \"try\" \":\" suite \"finally\" \":\" suite try1_stmt try2_stmt try3_stmt suite expression identifier suite suite suite suite expression identifier suite suite suite suite suite Additional information on exceptions can be found in section Exceptions, and information on using the raise statement to generate exceptions may be found in section The raise statement. raise ### 8. 4. 1. except clause¶ except The except clause(s) specify one or more exception handlers. When no exception occurs in the try clause, no exception handler is executed. When an exception occurs in the try suite, a search for an exception handler is started. This search inspects the except clauses in turn until one is found that matches the exception. An expression-less except clause, if present, must be last; it matches any exception.",
