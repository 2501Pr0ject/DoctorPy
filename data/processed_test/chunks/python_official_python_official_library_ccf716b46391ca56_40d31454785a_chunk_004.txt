For example, on the 6-character string 'aaaaaa', a{3,5} will match 5 'a' characters, while a{3,5}. will only match 3 characters. 'aaaaaa' a{3,5} 'a' a{3,5}. {m,n}+ Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible without establishing any backtracking points. This is the possessive version of the quantifier above. For example, on the 6-character string 'aaaaaa', a{3,5}+aa attempt to match 5 'a' characters, then, requiring 2 more 'a's, will need more characters than available and thus fail, while a{3,5}aa will match with a{3,5} capturing 5, then 4 'a's by backtracking and then the final 2 'a's are matched by the final aa in the pattern. x{m,n}+ is equivalent to (. >x{m,n}). 'aaaaaa' a{3,5}+aa 'a' 'a' a{3,5}aa a{3,5} 'a' 'a' aa x{m,n}+ (. >x{m,n}) Added in version 3. 11. \ Either escapes special characters (permitting you to match characters like '', '. ', and so forth), or signals a special sequence; special sequences are discussed below. '*' '. ' If you’re not using a raw string to express the pattern, remember that Python also uses the backslash as an escape sequence in string literals; if the escape sequence isn’t recognized by Python’s parser, the backslash and subsequent character are included in the resulting string. However, if Python would recognize the resulting sequence, the backslash should be repeated twice. This is complicated and hard to understand, so it’s highly recommended that you use raw strings for all but the simplest expressions. [] Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set: Characters can be listed individually, e. g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'. Characters can be listed individually, e. g. [amk] will match 'a', 'm', or 'k'.
