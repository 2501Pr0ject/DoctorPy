On read the internal counter is decremented by one. eventfd() Availability: Linux >= 2. 6. 30 Added in version 3. 10. ### Timer File Descriptors¶ Added in version 3. 13. These functions provide support for Linux’s timer file descriptor API. Naturally, they are all only available on Linux. Create and return a timer file descriptor (timerfd). The file descriptor returned by timerfd_create() supports: timerfd_create() read() read() read() select() select() select() poll() poll() poll() The file descriptor’s read() method can be called with a buffer size of 8. If the timer has already expired one or more times, read() returns the number of expirations with the host’s endianness, which may be converted to an int by int. from_bytes(x, byteorder=sys. byteorder). read() read() int int. from_bytes(x, byteorder=sys. byteorder) select() and poll() can be used to wait until timer expires and the file descriptor is readable. select() poll() clockid must be a valid clock ID, as defined in the time module: time time. CLOCK_REALTIME time. CLOCK_REALTIME time. CLOCK_REALTIME time. CLOCK_MONOTONIC time. CLOCK_MONOTONIC time. CLOCK_MONOTONIC time. CLOCK_BOOTTIME (Since Linux 3.",
