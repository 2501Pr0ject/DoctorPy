Not every drive name will be associated with a volume, and some may be inaccessible for a variety of reasons, including permissions, network connectivity or missing media. This function does not test for access. 'C:\\' May raise OSError if an error occurs collecting the drive names. OSError Raises an auditing event os. listdrives with no arguments. os. listdrives Availability: Windows Added in version 3. 12. Return a list containing the mount points for a volume on a Windows system. volume must be represented as a GUID path, like those returned by os. listvolumes(). Volumes may be mounted in multiple locations or not at all. In the latter case, the list will be empty. Mount points that are not associated with a volume will not be returned by this function. os. listvolumes() The mount points return by this function will be absolute paths, and may be longer than the drive name. Raises OSError if the volume is not recognized or if an error occurs collecting the paths. OSError Raises an auditing event os. listmounts with argument volume. os. listmounts volume Availability: Windows Added in version 3. 12. Return a list containing the volumes in the system. Volumes are typically represented as a GUID path that looks like \. \Volume{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}. Files can usually be accessed through a GUID path, permissions allowing. However, users are generally not familiar with them, and so the recommended use of this function is to retrieve mount points using os. listmounts(). \\. \Volume{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}\ os. listmounts() May raise OSError if an error occurs collecting the volumes. OSError Raises an auditing event os. listvolumes with no arguments. os. listvolumes Availability: Windows Added in version 3. 12. Perform the equivalent of an lstat() system call on the given path. Similar to stat(), but does not follow symbolic links. Return a stat_result object. lstat() stat() stat_result On platforms that do not support symbolic links, this is an alias for stat(). stat() As of Python 3. 3, this is equivalent to os. stat(path, dir_fd=dir_fd, follow_symlinks=False). os. stat(path, dir_fd=dir_fd, follow_symlinks=False) This function can also support paths relative to directory descriptors.
