  "content": "Odds and Ends¶ Sometimes it is useful to have a data type similar to the Pascal “record” or C “struct”, bundling together a few named data items. The idiomatic approach is to use dataclasses for this purpose: dataclasses from dataclasses import dataclass @dataclass class Employee: name: str dept: str salary: int >>> john = Employee('john', 'computer lab', 1000) >>> john. dept 'computer lab' >>> john. salary 1000 A piece of Python code that expects a particular abstract data type can often be passed a class that emulates the methods of that data type instead. For instance, if you have a function that formats some data from a file object, you can define a class with methods read() and readline() that get the data from a string buffer instead, and pass it as an argument. read() readline() Instance method objects have attributes, too: m. self is the instance object with the method m(), and m. func is the function object corresponding to the method. m. __self__ m() m. __func__ ## 9. 8. Iterators¶ By now you have probably noticed that most container objects can be looped over using a for statement: for for element in [1, 2, 3]: print(element) for element in (1, 2, 3): print(element) for key in {'one':1, 'two':2}: print(key) for char in \"123\": print(char) for line in open(\"myfile. txt\"): print(line, end='') This style of access is clear, concise, and convenient. The use of iterators pervades and unifies Python. Behind the scenes, the for statement calls iter() on the container object. The function returns an iterator object that defines the method next() which accesses elements in the container one at a time. When there are no more elements, next() raises a StopIteration exception which tells the for loop to terminate.",
