Used to disambiguate wall times during a repeated interval. (A repeated interval occurs when clocks are rolled back at the end of daylight saving time or when the UTC offset for the current zone is decreased for political reasons. ) The values 0 and 1 represent, respectively, the earlier and later of the two moments with the same wall time representation. [0, 1] Added in version 3. 6. Supported operations: Operation Result datetime2 = datetime1 + timedelta datetime2 = datetime1 + timedelta (1) datetime2 = datetime1 - timedelta datetime2 = datetime1 - timedelta (2) timedelta = datetime1 - datetime2 timedelta = datetime1 - datetime2 (3) datetime1 == datetime2 datetime1. = datetime2 Equality comparison. (4) datetime1 < datetime2 datetime1 > datetime2 datetime1 <= datetime2 datetime1 >= datetime2 Order comparison. (5) datetime2 is a duration of timedelta removed from datetime1, moving forward in time if timedelta. days > 0, or backward if timedelta. days < 0. The result has the same tzinfo attribute as the input datetime, and datetime2 - datetime1 == timedelta after. OverflowError is raised if datetime2. year would be smaller than MINYEAR or larger than MAXYEAR. Note that no time zone adjustments are done even if the input is an aware object. datetime2 is a duration of timedelta removed from datetime1, moving forward in time if timedelta. days > 0, or backward if timedelta. days < 0.

As for addition, the result has the same tzinfo attribute as the input datetime, and no time zone adjustments are done even if the input is aware. Computes the datetime2 such that datetime2 + timedelta == datetime1.
