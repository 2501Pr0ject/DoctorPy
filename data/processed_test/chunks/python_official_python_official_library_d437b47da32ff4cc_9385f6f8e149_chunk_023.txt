See also get_int_max_str_digits(). get_int_max_str_digits() Added in version 3. 11. Set the system’s profile function, which allows you to implement a Python source code profiler in Python. See chapter The Python Profilers for more information on the Python profiler. The system’s profile function is called similarly to the system’s trace function (see settrace()), but it is called with different events, for example it isn’t called for each executed line of code (only on call and return, but the return event is reported even when an exception has been set). The function is thread-specific, but there is no way for the profiler to know about context switches between threads, so it does not make sense to use this in the presence of multiple threads. Also, its return value is not used, so it can simply return None. Error in the profile function will cause itself unset. settrace() None Note The same tracing mechanism is used for setprofile() as settrace(). To trace calls with setprofile() inside a tracing function (e. g. in a debugger breakpoint), see call_tracing(). setprofile() settrace() setprofile() call_tracing() Profile functions should have three arguments: frame, event, and arg. frame is the current stack frame. event is a string: 'call', 'return', 'c_call', 'c_return', or 'c_exception'. arg depends on the event type. 'call' 'return' 'c_call' 'c_return' 'c_exception' The events have the following meaning: 'call' A function is called (or some other code block entered). The profile function is called; arg is None. None 'return' A function (or other code block) is about to return. The profile function is called; arg is the value that will be returned, or None if the event is caused by an exception being raised. None 'c_call' A C function is about to be called.
