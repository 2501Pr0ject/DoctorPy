Match objects are considered atomic. copy. copy() copy. deepcopy() ## Regular Expression Examples¶ ### Checking for a Pair¶ In this example, we’ll use the following helper function to display match objects a little more gracefully: def displaymatch(match): if match is None: return None return '<Match: %r, groups=%r>' % (match. group(), match. groups()) Suppose you are writing a poker program where a player’s hand is represented as a 5-character string with each character representing a card, “a” for ace, “k” for king, “q” for queen, “j” for jack, “t” for 10, and “2” through “9” representing the card with that value. To see if a given string is a valid hand, one could do the following: >>> valid = re. compile(r\"^[a2-9tjqk]{5}$\") >>> displaymatch(valid. match(\"akt5q\")) # Valid. \"<Match: 'akt5q', groups=()>\" >>> displaymatch(valid. match(\"akt5e\")) # Invalid. >>> displaymatch(valid. match(\"akt\")) # Invalid. >>> displaymatch(valid. match(\"727ak\")) # Valid. \"<Match: '727ak', groups=()>\" That last hand, \"727ak\", contained a pair, or two of the same valued cards. To match this with a regular expression, one could use backreferences as such: \"727ak\" >>> pair = re. compile(r\". *(. ). *\\1\") >>> displaymatch(pair.",
