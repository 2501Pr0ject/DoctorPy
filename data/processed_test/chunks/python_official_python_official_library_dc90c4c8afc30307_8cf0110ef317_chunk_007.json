Changed in version 3. 12: Added the steps argument. Return the value of the least significant bit of the float x: If x is a NaN (not a number), return x. If x is a NaN (not a number), return x. If x is negative, return ulp(-x). If x is negative, return ulp(-x). ulp(-x) If x is a positive infinity, return x. If x is a positive infinity, return x. If x is equal to zero, return the smallest positive denormalized representable float (smaller than the minimum positive normalized float, sys. float_info. min). If x is equal to zero, return the smallest positive denormalized representable float (smaller than the minimum positive normalized float, sys. float_info. min). sys. float_info. min If x is equal to the largest positive representable float, return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float smaller than x is x - ulp(x). If x is equal to the largest positive representable float, return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float smaller than x is x - ulp(x). x - ulp(x) Otherwise (x is a positive finite number), return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float bigger than x is x + ulp(x).",
