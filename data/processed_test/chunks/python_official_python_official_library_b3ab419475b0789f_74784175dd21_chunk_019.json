Walking the tree bottom-up is essential as rmdir() doesn’t allow deleting a directory before it is empty: shutil. rmtree() rmdir() # Delete everything reachable from the directory \"top\". # CAUTION: This is dangerous. For example, if top == Path('/'), # it could delete all of your files. for root, dirs, files in top. walk(top_down=False): for name in files: (root / name). unlink() for name in dirs: (root / name). rmdir() Added in version 3. 12. ### Creating files and directories¶ Create a file at this given path. If mode is given, it is combined with the process’s umask value to determine the file mode and access flags. If the file already exists, the function succeeds when exist_ok is true (and its modification time is updated to the current time), otherwise FileExistsError is raised. umask FileExistsError See also The open(), write_text() and write_bytes() methods are often used to create files. open() write_text() write_bytes() Create a new directory at this given path. If mode is given, it is combined with the process’s umask value to determine the file mode and access flags. If the path already exists, FileExistsError is raised. umask FileExistsError If parents is true, any missing parents of this path are created as needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking mode into account (mimicking the POSIX mkdir -p command). mkdir -p If parents is false (the default), a missing parent raises FileNotFoundError. FileNotFoundError If exist_ok is false (the default), FileExistsError is raised if the target directory already exists. FileExistsError If exist_ok is true, FileExistsError will not be raised unless the given path already exists in the file system and is not a directory (same behavior as the POSIX mkdir -p command). FileExistsError mkdir -p Changed in version 3. 5: The exist_ok parameter was added. Make this path a symbolic link pointing to target. On Windows, a symlink represents either a file or a directory, and does not morph to the target dynamically.",
