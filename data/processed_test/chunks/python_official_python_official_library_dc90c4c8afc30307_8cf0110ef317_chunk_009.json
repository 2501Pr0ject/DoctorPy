  "content": "This is usually more accurate than log(x, 10). log(x, 10) Return x raised to the power y. Exceptional cases follow the IEEE 754 standard as far as possible. In particular, pow(1. 0, x) and pow(x, 0. 0) always return 1. 0, even when x is a zero or a NaN. If both x and y are finite, x is negative, and y is not an integer then pow(x, y) is undefined, and raises ValueError. pow(1. 0, x) pow(x, 0. 0) 1. 0 pow(x, y) ValueError Unlike the built-in ** operator, math. pow() converts both its arguments to type float. Use ** or the built-in pow() function for computing exact integer powers. ** math. pow() float ** pow() Changed in version 3. 11: The special cases pow(0. 0, -inf) and pow(-0. 0, -inf) were changed to return inf instead of raising ValueError, for consistency with IEEE 754. pow(0. 0, -inf) pow(-0. 0, -inf) inf ValueError Return the square root of x. ## Summation and product functions¶ Return the Euclidean distance between two points p and q, each given as a sequence (or iterable) of coordinates. The two points must have the same dimension. Roughly equivalent to: sqrt(sum((px - qx) ** 2. 0 for px, qx in zip(p, q))) Added in version 3. 8. Return an accurate floating-point sum of values in the iterable. Avoids loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial sums. The algorithm’s accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees and the typical case where the rounding mode is half-even. On some non-Windows builds, the underlying C library uses extended precision addition and may occasionally double-round an intermediate sum causing it to be off in its least significant bit. For further discussion and two alternative approaches, see the ASPN cookbook recipes for accurate floating-point summation. Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(sum(x2 for x in coordinates)). This is the length of the vector from the origin to the point given by the coordinates.",
