from_bytes(b'\xfc\x00', byteorder='big', signed=False) 64512 >>> int. from_bytes([255, 0, 0], byteorder='big') 16711680 The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an iterable producing bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to "big". If byteorder is "big", the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is "little", the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the native byte order of the host system, use sys. byteorder as the byte order value. "big" "big" "little" sys. byteorder The signed argument indicates whether two’s complement is used to represent the integer. Equivalent to: def from_bytes(bytes, byteorder='big', signed=False): if byteorder == 'little': little_ordered = list(bytes) elif byteorder == 'big': little_ordered = list(reversed(bytes)) else: raise ValueError("byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'") n = sum(b << i*8 for i, b in enumerate(little_ordered)) if signed and little_ordered and (little_ordered[-1] & 0x80): n -= 1 << 8*len(little_ordered) return n Added in version 3. 2. Changed in version 3. 11: Added default argument value for byteorder. byteorder Return a pair of integers whose ratio is equal to the original integer and has a positive denominator. The integer ratio of integers (whole numbers) is always the integer as the numerator and 1 as the denominator. 1 Added in version 3. 8. Returns True. Exists for duck type compatibility with float. is_integer(). True float. is_integer() Added in version 3. 12. ### Additional Methods on Float¶ The float type implements the numbers. Real abstract base class. float also has the following additional methods. numbers. Real Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original float. The ratio is in lowest terms and has a positive denominator. Raises OverflowError on infinities and a ValueError on NaNs. OverflowError ValueError Return True if the float instance is finite with integral value, and False otherwise: True False >>> (-2. 0). is_integer() True >>> (3. 2).
