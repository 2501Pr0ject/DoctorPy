  "content": "This function must not be called if WIFSTOPPED(status) is true. waitpid() WUNTRACED WIFSTOPPED(status) WIFSTOPPED(status) See also WIFEXITED(), WEXITSTATUS(), WIFSIGNALED(), WTERMSIG(), WIFSTOPPED(), WSTOPSIG() functions. WIFEXITED() WEXITSTATUS() WIFSIGNALED() WTERMSIG() WIFSTOPPED() WSTOPSIG() Availability: Unix, Windows, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Added in version 3. 9. The following functions take a process status code as returned by system(), wait(), or waitpid() as a parameter. They may be used to determine the disposition of a process. system() wait() waitpid() Return True if a core dump was generated for the process, otherwise return False. True False This function should be employed only if WIFSIGNALED() is true. WIFSIGNALED() Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Return True if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT (if the process has been continued from a job control stop), otherwise return False. True SIGCONT False See WCONTINUED option. WCONTINUED Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Return True if the process was stopped by delivery of a signal, otherwise return False. True False WIFSTOPPED() only returns True if the waitpid() call was done using WUNTRACED option or when the process is being traced (see ptrace(2)). WIFSTOPPED() True waitpid() WUNTRACED Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Return True if the process was terminated by a signal, otherwise return False. True False Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Return True if the process exited terminated normally, that is, by calling exit() or _exit(), or by returning from main(); otherwise return False. True exit() _exit() main() False Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Return the process exit status. This function should be employed only if WIFEXITED() is true. WIFEXITED() Availability: Unix, not WASI, not Android, not iOS. Return the signal which caused the process to stop.",
