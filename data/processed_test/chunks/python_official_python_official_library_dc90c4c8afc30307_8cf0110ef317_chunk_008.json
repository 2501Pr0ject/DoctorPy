  "content": "Otherwise (x is a positive finite number), return the value of the least significant bit of x, such that the first float bigger than x is x + ulp(x). x + ulp(x) ULP stands for “Unit in the Last Place”. See also math. nextafter() and sys. float_info. epsilon. math. nextafter() sys. float_info. epsilon Added in version 3. 9. ## Power, exponential and logarithmic functions¶ Return the cube root of x. Added in version 3. 11. Return e raised to the power x, where e = 2. 718281… is the base of natural logarithms. This is usually more accurate than math. e ** x or pow(math. e, x). math. e ** x pow(math. e, x) Return 2 raised to the power x. Added in version 3. 11. Return e raised to the power x, minus 1. Here e is the base of natural logarithms. For small floats x, the subtraction in exp(x) - 1 can result in a significant loss of precision; the expm1() function provides a way to compute this quantity to full precision: exp(x) - 1 expm1() >>> from math import exp, expm1 >>> exp(1e-5) - 1 # gives result accurate to 11 places 1. 0000050000069649e-05 >>> expm1(1e-5) # result accurate to full precision 1. 0000050000166668e-05 Added in version 3. 2. With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e). With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base, calculated as log(x)/log(base). log(x)/log(base) Return the natural logarithm of 1+x (base e). The result is calculated in a way which is accurate for x near zero. Return the base-2 logarithm of x. This is usually more accurate than log(x, 2). log(x, 2) Added in version 3. 3. See also int. bit_length() returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. int. bit_length() Return the base-10 logarithm of x.",
