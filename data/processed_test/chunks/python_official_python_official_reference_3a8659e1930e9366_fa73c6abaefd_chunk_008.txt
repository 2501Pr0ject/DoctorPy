__dict__ attributes A dictionary containing annotations of parameters. The keys of the dictionary are the parameter names, and 'return' for the return annotation, if provided. See also: Annotations Best Practices. dictionary 'return' A dictionary containing defaults for keyword-only parameters. dictionary A tuple containing the type parameters of a generic function. tuple Added in version 3. 12. Function objects also support getting and setting arbitrary attributes, which can be used, for example, to attach metadata to functions. Regular attribute dot-notation is used to get and set such attributes. CPython implementation detail: CPython’s current implementation only supports function attributes on user-defined functions. Function attributes on built-in functions may be supported in the future. Additional information about a function’s definition can be retrieved from its code object (accessible via the code attribute). __code__ #### 3. 2. 8. 2. Instance methods¶ An instance method object combines a class, a class instance and any callable object (normally a user-defined function). Special read-only attributes: Refers to the class instance object to which the method is bound Refers to the original function object The method’s documentation (same as method. func. doc). A string if the original function had a docstring, else None. method. __func__. __doc__ string None The name of the method (same as method. func. name) method. __func__. __name__ The name of the module the method was defined in, or None if unavailable. None Methods also support accessing (but not setting) the arbitrary function attributes on the underlying function object. User-defined method objects may be created when getting an attribute of a class (perhaps via an instance of that class), if that attribute is a user-defined function object or a classmethod object. classmethod When an instance method object is created by retrieving a user-defined function object from a class via one of its instances, its self attribute is the instance, and the method object is said to be bound. The new method’s func attribute is the original function object. __self__ __func__ When an instance method object is created by retrieving a classmethod object from a class or instance, its self attribute is the class itself, and its func attribute is the function object underlying the class method.
