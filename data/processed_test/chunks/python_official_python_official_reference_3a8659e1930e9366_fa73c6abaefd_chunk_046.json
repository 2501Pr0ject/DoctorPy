  "content": "Also, an object that doesn’t define a bool() method and whose len() method returns zero is considered to be false in a Boolean context. len() >= __bool__() __len__() CPython implementation detail: In CPython, the length is required to be at most sys. maxsize. If the length is larger than sys. maxsize some features (such as len()) may raise OverflowError. To prevent raising OverflowError by truth value testing, an object must define a bool() method. sys. maxsize sys. maxsize len() OverflowError OverflowError __bool__() Called to implement operator. length_hint(). Should return an estimated length for the object (which may be greater or less than the actual length). The length must be an integer >= 0. The return value may also be NotImplemented, which is treated the same as if the length_hint method didn’t exist at all. This method is purely an optimization and is never required for correctness. operator. length_hint() >= NotImplemented __length_hint__ Added in version 3. 4. Note Slicing is done exclusively with the following three methods. A call like a[1:2] = b is translated to a[slice(1, 2, None)] = b and so forth. Missing slice items are always filled in with None. None Called to implement evaluation of self[key]. For sequence types, the accepted keys should be integers. Optionally, they may support slice objects as well. Negative index support is also optional. If key is of an inappropriate type, TypeError may be raised; if key is a value outside the set of indexes for the sequence (after any special interpretation of negative values), IndexError should be raised. For mapping types, if key is missing (not in the container), KeyError should be raised. self[key] slice TypeError IndexError KeyError Note for loops expect that an IndexError will be raised for illegal indexes to allow proper detection of the end of the sequence. for IndexError Note When subscripting a class, the special class method class_getitem() may be called instead of getitem(). See class_getitem versus getitem for more details. __class_getitem__() __getitem__() Called to implement assignment to self[key]. Same note as for getitem(). This should only be implemented for mappings if the objects support changes to the values for keys, or if new keys can be added, or for sequences if elements can be replaced.",
