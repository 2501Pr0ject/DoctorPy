  "content": "The ffffff part is omitted when the offset is a whole number of seconds and both the ffffff and the SS part is omitted when the offset is a whole number of minutes. For example, if utcoffset() returns timedelta(hours=-3, minutes=-30), %z is replaced with the string '-0330'. Changed in version 3. 7: The UTC offset is not restricted to a whole number of minutes. Changed in version 3. 7: When the %z directive is provided to the strptime() method, the UTC offsets can have a colon as a separator between hours, minutes and seconds. For example, '+01:00:00' will be parsed as an offset of one hour. In addition, providing 'Z' is identical to '+00:00'. %:zBehaves exactly as %z, but has a colon separator added between hours, minutes and seconds. %ZIn strftime(), %Z is replaced by an empty string if tzname() returns None; otherwise %Z is replaced by the returned value, which must be a string. strptime() only accepts certain values for %Z: any value in time. tzname for your machine’s locale the hard-coded values UTC and GMT So someone living in Japan may have JST, UTC, and GMT as valid values, but probably not EST. It will raise ValueError for invalid values. Changed in version 3. 2: When the %z directive is provided to the strptime() method, an aware datetime object will be produced. The tzinfo of the result will be set to a timezone instance. For a naive object, the %z, %:z and %Z format codes are replaced by empty strings. %z %:z %Z For an aware object: %z utcoffset() is transformed into a string of the form ±HHMM[SS[. ffffff]], where HH is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset hours, MM is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset minutes, SS is a 2-digit string giving the number of UTC offset seconds and ffffff is a 6-digit string giving the number of UTC offset microseconds. The ffffff part is omitted when the offset is a whole number of seconds and both the ffffff and the SS part is omitted when the offset is a whole number of minutes.",
