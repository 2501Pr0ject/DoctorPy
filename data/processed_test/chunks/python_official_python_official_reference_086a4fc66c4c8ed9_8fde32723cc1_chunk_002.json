  "content": "A list of the remaining items in the iterable is then assigned to the starred target (the list can be empty). Else: The object must be an iterable with the same number of items as there are targets in the target list, and the items are assigned, from left to right, to the corresponding targets. Else: The object must be an iterable with the same number of items as there are targets in the target list, and the items are assigned, from left to right, to the corresponding targets. Assignment of an object to a single target is recursively defined as follows. If the target is an identifier (name): If the name does not occur in a global or nonlocal statement in the current code block: the name is bound to the object in the current local namespace. Otherwise: the name is bound to the object in the global namespace or the outer namespace determined by nonlocal, respectively. The name is rebound if it was already bound. This may cause the reference count for the object previously bound to the name to reach zero, causing the object to be deallocated and its destructor (if it has one) to be called. If the target is an identifier (name): If the name does not occur in a global or nonlocal statement in the current code block: the name is bound to the object in the current local namespace.

This may cause the reference count for the object previously bound to the name to reach zero, causing the object to be deallocated and its destructor (if it has one) to be called. If the target is an attribute reference: The primary expression in the reference is evaluated. It should yield an object with assignable attributes; if this is not the case, TypeError is raised. That object is then asked to assign the assigned object to the given attribute; if it cannot perform the assignment, it raises an exception (usually but not necessarily AttributeError).",
