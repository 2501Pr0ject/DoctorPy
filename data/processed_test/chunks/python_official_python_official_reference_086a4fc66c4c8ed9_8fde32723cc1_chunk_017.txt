TypeAliasType For example, the following statement creates a type alias: type Point = tuple[float, float] This code is roughly equivalent to: annotation-def VALUE_OF_Point(): return tuple[float, float] Point = typing. TypeAliasType("Point", VALUE_OF_Point()) annotation-def indicates an annotation scope, which behaves mostly like a function, but with several small differences. annotation-def The value of the type alias is evaluated in the annotation scope. It is not evaluated when the type alias is created, but only when the value is accessed through the type aliasâ€™s value attribute (see Lazy evaluation). This allows the type alias to refer to names that are not yet defined. __value__ Type aliases may be made generic by adding a type parameter list after the name. See Generic type aliases for more. type is a soft keyword. type Added in version 3. 12. See also Introduced the type statement and syntax for generic classes and functions. type ### Table of Contents 7. Simple statements 7. 1. Expression statements 7. 2. Assignment statements 7. 2. 1.
