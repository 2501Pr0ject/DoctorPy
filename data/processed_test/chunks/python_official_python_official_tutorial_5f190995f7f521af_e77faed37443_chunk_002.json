  "content": "In most cases Python programmers do not use this facility since it introduces an unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly hiding some things you have already defined. _ Note that in general the practice of importing * from a module or package is frowned upon, since it often causes poorly readable code. However, it is okay to use it to save typing in interactive sessions. * If the module name is followed by as, then the name following as is bound directly to the imported module. as as >>> import fibo as fib >>> fib. fib(500) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 This is effectively importing the module in the same way that import fibo will do, with the only difference of it being available as fib. import fibo fib It can also be used when utilising from with similar effects: from >>> from fibo import fib as fibonacci >>> fibonacci(500) 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 Note For efficiency reasons, each module is only imported once per interpreter session. Therefore, if you change your modules, you must restart the interpreter – or, if it’s just one module you want to test interactively, use importlib. reload(), e. g. import importlib; importlib. reload(modulename). importlib. reload() import importlib; importlib. reload(modulename) ### 6. 1. 1. Executing modules as scripts¶ When you run a Python module with python fibo. py <arguments> the code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the name set to \"main\". That means that by adding this code at the end of your module: __name__ \"__main__\" if __name__ == \"__main__\": import sys fib(int(sys. argv[1])) you can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable module, because the code that parses the command line only runs if the module is executed as the “main” file: $ python fibo.",
