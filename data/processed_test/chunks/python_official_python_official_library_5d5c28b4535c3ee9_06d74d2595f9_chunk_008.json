  "content": "This can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers are encountered. '-Infinity' 'Infinity' 'NaN' If strict is false (True is the default), then control characters will be allowed inside strings. Control characters in this context are those with character codes in the 0–31 range, including '\\t' (tab), '\\n', '\\r' and '\\0'. True '\\t' '\\n' '\\r' '\\0' If the data being deserialized is not a valid JSON document, a JSONDecodeError will be raised. JSONDecodeError Changed in version 3. 6: All parameters are now keyword-only. Return the Python representation of s (a str instance containing a JSON document). str JSONDecodeError will be raised if the given JSON document is not valid. JSONDecodeError Decode a JSON document from s (a str beginning with a JSON document) and return a 2-tuple of the Python representation and the index in s where the document ended. str This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may have extraneous data at the end. Extensible JSON encoder for Python data structures. Supports the following objects and types by default: Python JSON dict object list, tuple array str string int, float, int- & float-derived Enums number True true False false None null Changed in version 3. 4: Added support for int- and float-derived Enum classes. To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a default() method with another method that returns a serializable object for o if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass implementation (to raise TypeError). default() o TypeError If skipkeys is false (the default), a TypeError will be raised when trying to encode keys that are not str, int, float, bool or None. If skipkeys is true, such items are simply skipped. TypeError str int float bool None If ensure_ascii is true (the default), the output is guaranteed to have all incoming non-ASCII characters escaped. If ensure_ascii is false, these characters will be output as-is. If check_circular is true (the default), then lists, dicts, and custom encoded objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause a RecursionError). Otherwise, no such check takes place. RecursionError If allow_nan is true (the default), then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be encoded as such.",
