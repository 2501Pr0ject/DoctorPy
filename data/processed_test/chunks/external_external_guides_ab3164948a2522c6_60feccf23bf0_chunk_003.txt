log', filemode='w', level=logging. DEBUG) The output will be the same as before, but the log file is no longer appended to, so the messages from earlier runs are lost. ### Logging variable data¶ To log variable data, use a format string for the event description message and append the variable data as arguments. For example: import logging logging. warning('%s before you %s', 'Look', 'leap. ') will display: WARNING:root:Look before you leap. As you can see, merging of variable data into the event description message uses the old, %-style of string formatting. This is for backwards compatibility: the logging package pre-dates newer formatting options such as str. format() and string. Template. These newer formatting options are supported, but exploring them is outside the scope of this tutorial: see Using particular formatting styles throughout your application for more information. str. format() string. Template ### Changing the format of displayed messages¶ To change the format which is used to display messages, you need to specify the format you want to use: import logging logging. basicConfig(format='%(levelname)s:%(message)s', level=logging. DEBUG) logging. debug('This message should appear on the console') logging. info('So should this') logging. warning('And this, too') which would print: DEBUG:This message should appear on the console INFO:So should this WARNING:And this, too Notice that the ‘root’ which appeared in earlier examples has disappeared. For a full set of things that can appear in format strings, you can refer to the documentation for LogRecord attributes, but for simple usage, you just need the levelname (severity), message (event description, including variable data) and perhaps to display when the event occurred. This is described in the next section. ### Displaying the date/time in messages¶ To display the date and time of an event, you would place ‘%(asctime)s’ in your format string: import logging logging. basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(message)s') logging. warning('is when this event was logged. ') which should print something like this: 2010-12-12 11:41:42,612 is when this event was logged. The default format for date/time display (shown above) is like ISO8601 or RFC 3339.
