[amk] 'a' 'm' 'k' Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-', for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59, and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit. If - is escaped (e. g. [a-z]) or if it’s placed as the first or last character (e. g. [-a] or [a-]), it will match a literal '-'.

For example, [(+)] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '', or ')'. Special characters except backslash lose their special meaning inside sets. For example, [(+)] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '', or ')'. [(+*)] '(' '+' '*' ')' Backslash either escapes characters which have special meaning in a set such as '-', ']', '^' and '\' itself or signals a special sequence which represents a single character such as \xa0 or \n or a character class such as \w or \S (defined below). Note that \b represents a single “backspace” character, not a word boundary as outside a set, and numeric escapes such as \1 are always octal escapes, not group references. Special sequences which do not match a single character such as \A and \Z are not allowed.
