  "content": "The 'z' option coerces negative zero floating-point values to positive zero after rounding to the format precision. This option is only valid for floating-point presentation types. 'z' Changed in version 3. 11: Added the 'z' option (see also PEP 682). 'z' The '#' option causes the “alternate form” to be used for the conversion. The alternate form is defined differently for different types. This option is only valid for integer, float and complex types. For integers, when binary, octal, or hexadecimal output is used, this option adds the respective prefix '0b', '0o', '0x', or '0X' to the output value. For float and complex the alternate form causes the result of the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. Normally, a decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it. In addition, for 'g' and 'G' conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result. '#' '0b' '0o' '0x' '0X' 'g' 'G' The width is a decimal integer defining the minimum total field width, including any prefixes, separators, and other formatting characters. If not specified, then the field width will be determined by the content. When no explicit alignment is given, preceding the width field by a zero ('0') character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types, excluding complex. This is equivalent to a fill character of '0' with an alignment type of '='. '0' complex '0' '=' Changed in version 3. 10: Preceding the width field by '0' no longer affects the default alignment for strings. '0' The grouping option after the width field specifies a digit group separator for the integral part of a number. It can be one of the following: Option Meaning ',' ',' Inserts a comma every 3 digits for integer presentation type 'd' and floating-point presentation types, excluding 'n'. For other presentation types, this option is not supported. 'd' 'n' '' '_' Inserts an underscore every 3 digits for integer presentation type 'd' and floating-point presentation types, excluding 'n'. For integer presentation types 'b', 'o', 'x', and 'X', underscores are inserted every 4 digits. For other presentation types, this option is not supported.",
