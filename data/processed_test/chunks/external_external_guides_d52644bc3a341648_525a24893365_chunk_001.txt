As PEP 20 says, “Readability counts”. A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important. However, know when to be inconsistent – sometimes style guide recommendations just aren’t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don’t hesitate to ask. In particular: do not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP. Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline: When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP. To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons) – although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else’s mess (in true XP style). Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code. When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of Python that don’t support the feature recommended by the style guide. ## Code Lay-out ### Indentation Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Continuation lines should align wrapped elements either vertically using Python’s implicit line joining inside parentheses, brackets and braces, or using a hanging indent [1]. When using a hanging indent the following should be considered; there should be no arguments on the first line and further indentation should be used to clearly distinguish itself as a continuation line: # Correct: # Aligned with opening delimiter. foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two, var_three, var_four) # Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest. def long_function_name( var_one, var_two, var_three, var_four): print(var_one) # Hanging indents should add a level. foo = long_function_name( var_one, var_two, var_three, var_four) # Wrong: # Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment. foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two, var_three, var_four) # Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable. def long_function_name( var_one, var_two, var_three, var_four): print(var_one) The 4-space rule is optional for continuation lines. Optional: # Hanging indents *may* be indented to other than 4 spaces.
