except clauseÂ¶ except* The except clause(s) are used for handling ExceptionGroups. The exception type for matching is interpreted as in the case of except, but in the case of exception groups we can have partial matches when the type matches some of the exceptions in the group. This means that multiple except clauses can execute, each handling part of the exception group. Each clause executes at most once and handles an exception group of all matching exceptions. Each exception in the group is handled by at most one except clause, the first that matches it. except* ExceptionGroup except except* except* >>> try:. raise ExceptionGroup("eg",. [ValueError(1), TypeError(2), OSError(3), OSError(4)]). except* TypeError as e:. print(f'caught {type(e)} with nested {e. exceptions}'). except* OSError as e:. print(f'caught {type(e)} with nested {e. exceptions}'). caught <class 'ExceptionGroup'> with nested (TypeError(2),) caught <class 'ExceptionGroup'> with nested (OSError(3), OSError(4)) + Exception Group Traceback (most recent call last): | File "<stdin>", line 2, in <module> | ExceptionGroup: eg +-+---------------- 1 ---------------- | ValueError: 1 +------------------------------------ Any remaining exceptions that were not handled by any except clause are re-raised at the end, along with all exceptions that were raised from within the except clauses. If this list contains more than one exception to reraise, they are combined into an exception group. except* except* If the raised exception is not an exception group and its type matches one of the except clauses, it is caught and wrapped by an exception group with an empty message string. except* >>> try:. raise BlockingIOError. except* BlockingIOError as e:. print(repr(e)). ExceptionGroup('', (BlockingIOError())) An except clause must have a matching expression; it cannot be except:. Furthermore, this expression cannot contain exception group types, because that would have ambiguous semantics. except* except*: It is not possible to mix except and except in the same try. break, continue and return cannot appear in an except clause. except except* try break continue return except* ### 8. 4. 3.
