  "content": "This improves the documentation by providing the user with an example and it allows the doctest module to make sure the code remains true to the documentation: doctest def average(values): \"\"\"Computes the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers. >>> print(average([20, 30, 70])) 40. 0 \"\"\" return sum(values) / len(values) import doctest doctest. testmod() # automatically validate the embedded tests The unittest module is not as effortless as the doctest module, but it allows a more comprehensive set of tests to be maintained in a separate file: unittest doctest import unittest class TestStatisticalFunctions(unittest. TestCase): def test_average(self): self. assertEqual(average([20, 30, 70]), 40. 0) self. assertEqual(round(average([1, 5, 7]), 1), 4. 3) with self. assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError): average([]) with self. assertRaises(TypeError): average(20, 30, 70) unittest. main() # Calling from the command line invokes all tests ## 10. 12. Batteries Included¶ Python has a “batteries included” philosophy. This is best seen through the sophisticated and robust capabilities of its larger packages. For example: The xmlrpc. client and xmlrpc. server modules make implementing remote procedure calls into an almost trivial task. Despite the modules’ names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed. The xmlrpc. client and xmlrpc. server modules make implementing remote procedure calls into an almost trivial task.

Unlike smtplib and poplib which actually send and receive messages, the email package has a complete toolset for building or decoding complex message structures (including attachments) and for implementing internet encoding and header protocols.
