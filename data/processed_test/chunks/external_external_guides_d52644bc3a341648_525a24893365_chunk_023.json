This is because such statements will implicitly cancel any active exception that is propagating through the finally suite:# Wrong: def foo(): try: 1 / 0 finally: return 42 return break continue try. finally # Wrong: def foo(): try: 1 / 0 finally: return 42 ### Function Annotations With the acceptance of PEP 484, the style rules for function annotations have changed. Function annotations should use PEP 484 syntax (there are some formatting recommendations for annotations in the previous section). The experimentation with annotation styles that was recommended previously in this PEP is no longer encouraged. However, outside the stdlib, experiments within the rules of PEP 484 are now encouraged.",
