pattern matches the colon after the last name, so that it does not occur in the result list. With a maxsplit of 4, we could separate the house number from the street name: :. maxsplit 4 >>> [re. split(":. ", entry, maxsplit=4) for entry in entries] [['Ross', 'McFluff', '834. 345. 1254', '155', 'Elm Street'], ['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892. 345. 3428', '436', 'Finley Avenue'], ['Frank', 'Burger', '925. 541. 7625', '662', 'South Dogwood Way'], ['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548. 326. 4584', '919', 'Park Place']] ### Text Munging¶ sub() replaces every occurrence of a pattern with a string or the result of a function. This example demonstrates using sub() with a function to “munge” text, or randomize the order of all the characters in each word of a sentence except for the first and last characters: sub() sub() >>> def repl(m):. inner_word = list(m. group(2)). random. shuffle(inner_word). return m. group(1) + "". join(inner_word) + m. group(3). >>> text = "Professor Abdolmalek, please report your absences promptly. " >>> re. sub(r"(\w)(\w+)(\w)", repl, text) 'Poefsrosr Aealmlobdk, pslaee reorpt your abnseces plmrptoy. ' >>> re. sub(r"(\w)(\w+)(\w)", repl, text) 'Pofsroser Aodlambelk, plasee reoprt yuor asnebces potlmrpy. ' ### Finding all Adverbs¶ findall() matches all occurrences of a pattern, not just the first one as search() does. For example, if a writer wanted to find all of the adverbs in some text, they might use findall() in the following manner: findall() search() findall() >>> text = "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police. " >>> re.
