"""Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n. """. result = []. a, b = 0, 1. while a < n:. result. append(a) # see below. a, b = b, a+b. return result. >>> f100 = fib2(100) # call it >>> f100 # write the result [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] This example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features: The return statement returns with a value from a function. return without an expression argument returns None. Falling off the end of a function also returns None. The return statement returns with a value from a function. return without an expression argument returns None. Falling off the end of a function also returns None. return return None None The statement result. append(a) calls a method of the list object result. A method is a function that ‘belongs’ to an object and is named obj. methodname, where obj is some object (this may be an expression), and methodname is the name of a method that is defined by the object’s type. Different types define different methods. Methods of different types may have the same name without causing ambiguity. (It is possible to define your own object types and methods, using classes, see Classes) The method append() shown in the example is defined for list objects; it adds a new element at the end of the list. In this example it is equivalent to result = result + [a], but more efficient. The statement result. append(a) calls a method of the list object result.
