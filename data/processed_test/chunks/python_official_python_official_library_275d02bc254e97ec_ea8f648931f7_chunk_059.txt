Similar to timerfd_settime(), but use time as nanoseconds. This function operates the same interval timer as timerfd_settime(). timerfd_settime() timerfd_settime() Availability: Linux >= 2. 6. 27 with glibc >= 2. 8 Added in version 3. 13. Return a two-item tuple of floats (next_expiration, interval). next_expiration interval next_expiration denotes the relative time until next the timer next fires, regardless of if the TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME flag is set. next_expiration TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME interval denotes the timer’s interval. If zero, the timer will only fire once, after next_expiration seconds have elapsed. interval next_expiration See also timerfd_gettime(2) Availability: Linux >= 2. 6. 27 with glibc >= 2. 8 Added in version 3. 13. Similar to timerfd_gettime(), but return time as nanoseconds. timerfd_gettime() Availability: Linux >= 2. 6. 27 with glibc >= 2. 8 Added in version 3. 13. A flag for the timerfd_create() function, which sets the O_NONBLOCK status flag for the new timer file descriptor. If TFD_NONBLOCK is not set as a flag, read() blocks. timerfd_create() O_NONBLOCK TFD_NONBLOCK read() Availability: Linux >= 2. 6. 27 with glibc >= 2. 8 Added in version 3. 13. A flag for the timerfd_create() function, If TFD_CLOEXEC is set as a flag, set close-on-exec flag for new file descriptor. timerfd_create() TFD_CLOEXEC Availability: Linux >= 2. 6. 27 with glibc >= 2. 8 Added in version 3. 13. A flag for the timerfd_settime() and timerfd_settime_ns() functions. If this flag is set, initial is interpreted as an absolute value on the timer’s clock (in UTC seconds or nanoseconds since the Unix Epoch). timerfd_settime() timerfd_settime_ns() Availability: Linux >= 2. 6. 27 with glibc >= 2. 8 Added in version 3. 13.
